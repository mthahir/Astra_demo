These initial storms, highlighted by a mostly outflow-dominant supercell, rapidly intensified across Polk County along the leading edge of a weak east-west line of convection sagging southward from northeast Nebraska. For the next several hours, the initial supercell cluster along with subsequent severe multicell storms developing along its outflow boundary dropped south-southeast through several counties, eventually exiting southern Thayer County around 8 PM CDT. Along the way, there were multiple reports of large hail up to golf ball size and damaging winds up to around 70 MPH. Although no tornadoes were reported, a brief funnel cloud was sighted near the York-Seward County line. One of the most notable areas of wind damage occurred in and near Waco in York County, where several trees and large branches were blown down in town, and three grain bins were destroyed a few miles southeast of town. In eastern Nuckolls County, several minutes of large hail resulted in crop damage along a narrow corridor between Oak and Ruskin. In addition to hail and wind, torrential rainfall of 2.5 to around 4 inches fell in a short time across parts of Polk and York Counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding, with water running over a few roads including Highway 81/92 just west of Osceola. ||Around the time the initial corridor of severe storms exited southeast portions of the area, a new east-west line of strong to severe convection flared up well to the northwest, first affecting areas west of Highway 281 and north of Interstate 80. Although this new line of storms eventually dropped southward across the majority of South Central Nebraska, the main focus for severe weather clearly targeted Dawson and Phelps Counties mainly between 9 and 11 PM CDT. Reports from these counties included a roof blown off an outbuilding west of Sumner, and ping pong ball size hail covering Highway 23 between Bertrand and Loomis. In addition, radar-derived products estimated that at least 4 inches of rain might have fallen across northern portions of Dawson County. Although this second round of severe storms weakened around 11 PM CDT, additional non-severe storms continued drifting through portions of South Central Nebraska well into the early morning hours of Thursday the 6th. ||The synoptic and mesoscale environment was quite supportive for southward moving clusters of severe storms, thanks to the combination of a very unstable airmass in the presence of favorable west-northwest flow aloft. Around the time of initial afternoon development in the Polk County area, MLCAPE values were quite high, around 4000 J/kg, in the presence of deep-layer vertical wind shear around 40 knots. Despite a lack of pronounced upper forcing, a corridor of weak shortwave energy spread into Nebraska from the north and west, focused along the northern periphery of a broad ridge centered over the southern United States. At the surface, an east-west quasi-stationary front took shape near the Nebraska-Kansas border during the afternoon. Light easterly breezes north of this boundary allowed low level moisture to pool, with surface dewpoints climbing into the low-mid 70s."

Severe weather in the form of large hail or damaging winds was not an issue during this event, with only a few reports of sub-severe wind gusts. For most of the 24-county area, overnight rainfall totaled no more than 1-2 inches. However, considerably heavier rain and localized flooding materialized across a fairly concentrated zone north of Interstate 80, generally centered near the borders of Polk, York, Hamilton and Merrick Counties. Within this area, gauge readings of 3-5 inches were common, with an unofficial report of nearly 6 inches near the community of Polk. The majority of this heavy rain fell between midnight and 2 AM CDT, and resulted in flash flooding with water running over a small segment of Highway 66, and also covering several county roads. Although the initial flash flooding quickly receded, the net result of 3-6 inches of rain from separate events during the past 36 hours likely resulted in stream and river flooding for the next few days, especially along the Big Blue River basin in southern Polk County. A gauge along the Big Blue near Surprise, just east of the Polk-Butler County line, eventually exceeded flood stage by Saturday evening the 9th. ||The expansive and rather slow-moving complex of storms that brought flooding rains during the night originated near the Nebraska-South Dakota border during the afternoon, gradually sinking southward within modest west-northwest flow aloft.

There was a brief tornado that touched down north of Atwater, Minnesota. However, most of the storm damage was with straight-line winds, some of which caused widespread damage near Sauk Centre. ||The worst damage, in terms of hundreds of trees uprooted or down power lines was across Douglas, Pope and Stearns Counties of west central and central Minnesota early in the storm's path."

IOWA,19,2012,May,Funnel Cloud,0,0,0,0,Law Enforcement,"The mid-to-late evening hours on this Sunday brought a rather widespread damaging wind event to the northwest half of South Central Nebraska, affecting locations mainly northwest of a line from Alma-Hastings-Osceola. The storm-mode featured a fast-moving, northeast-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that first entered Furnas County in the far southwest corner of the area around 8 PM CDT, and eventually exited far northeast counties such as Nance and Greeley between 1130 PM and midnight CDT. Over the course of these four hours, there were multiple reports of damaging winds in the 60-80 MPH range, but only few reports of large hail, highlighted by ping pong ball size stones near Holdrege. Measured wind gusts at airport sites included 68 MPH at Kearney and 64 MPH at Grand Island. Extensive tree damage was reported in several communities, including Edison, Kearney, Grand Island, Loup City, North Loup, Scotia and Greeley, just to name a few. In Grand Island, a 50-60 foot cottonwood tree narrowly missed a home as it fell, while on the west edge of Holdrege, an empty trailer home was blown over. In addition to tree and power line damage, considerable crop damage resulted across the area, primarily from green snap of rapidly growing corn. Due to the fast-moving nature of the primary squall line, rainfall amounts in most areas were no more than 0.50 to 1.50 inches. ||The initial clusters of storms that eventually congealed into the northward-propagating MCS developed during the late afternoon and early evening hours across central and northwest Kansas, near a subtle east-west front and within a zone of steep low-level lapse rates. A very unstable airmass was poised north of this surface front, with dewpoints well into the 70s across nearly all of South Central Nebraska. Storms evolved into prolific wind-producers thanks to efficient cold pool generation, aided by the development of a modest 25-30 knot low-level jet focused near the Nebraska-Kansas border.  Mesoscale parameters during the early stages of the event featured high MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg, in the presence of at least 30 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear. Aloft, the synoptic pattern featured an expansive mid-level ridge across the southern states, and a broad trough across the northwest United States, with the local area positioned on the southern periphery of the stronger west-southwest flow between these two features."

FLORIDA,12,2012,May,Tornado,0,0,0,0,State Official,"A very unstable airmass was in place over Iowa with CAPE values around 6000 J/kg and lifted indices around -11 C.  The downdraft CAPE was 1500 to 1900 J/kg.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was high, in the 800 to 1200 J/kg range, however the freezing level was 15,500 feet, limiting the hail production.  The shear profile was relatively weak with 30 kts of effective shear available.  Predawn temperatures were in the upper 70s to around 80, with dewpoints in the mid 70s.  Precipitable water values were in the 1.5 to 2 inch range, boosted by a 35 kt low level jet.  Thunderstorms formed in two complexes along a weak frontal boundary extending from Minnesota into Kansas.  One of the complexes pushed north and east out of Kansas and Nebraska, the second was over southern Minnesota.  The two filled in during the night as the whole system moved into richer air.  An outflow boundary was located across northern Iowa from the complex in Minnesota, enhancing convection there.  As the storms moved into Iowa, the primary threat came in the form of wind with wind gusts of 40 to 60 MPH associated with the fast moving forward propagating MCS.  Wind damage occurred in the Atlantic area with a tree blocking U.S. Highway 6.  This cluster of storms continued to move across the state at around 55 MPH.  Wind damage occurred in the Des Moines area with tree branches down and power line damage caused by 60 MPH winds.  A 59 MPH wind gust was recorded at the Ames Airport as the storms passed.  As the complex of storms continued east out of central Iowa, widespread damage occurred across Marshall and Tama Counties with winds of 70 to 100 MPH.  Two radio towers were downed, one in central Tama County, the other in northern Polk County.  A local television station's weather radar was destroyed near Alleman, also in Polk County.  Local wind speeds in these areas were estimated as high as 115 MPH.  Widespread power outages were reported with 90% of the power still out in Marshall County, and 75% out in Tama County 12 hours after the event.  Power was out for 3 to 4 days in some places.  Governor Terry Brandstad gave a State Disaster Proclamation to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties due the extensive damage.  A presidential declaration for major disaster was also given to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties.  A broad area of severe damage occurred with a path 5 miles wide of EF1 type damage caused by the high winds.  A path, 10 miles wide, of 70 to 80 MPH was surveyed, with a 15 to 20 mile wide path of wind speeds above 60 MPH.  The damage swath was nearly continuous with no evidence of tornadoes.  It extended from southern Story and northern Polk Counties, through Marshall, and Tama Counties, and was about 75 miles in length before exiting the CWA.  Crop losses were substantial with around 40% or greater loss on over 100,000 acres of corn and soy beans.  The corn had much more damage than the bean plants, with damage on these acres estimated at $95,000,000.  Other damage occurred around the area as well.  This derecho event was the most widespread one to affect central and east central Iowa since the June 1998 event.  Some examples of the notable wind speeds estimated from the survey include 96 MPH near Huxley, 94 MPH near Maxwell, 70 to 90 MPH near Marshalltown, 105 MPH east of Garwin, 85 to 97 MPH between Garwin and Union Grove State Park, 100 MPH south of Traer, and south to southwest of Dysart 105 to 115 MPH, with 80 to 100 MPH winds just south of that part of the swath.  One dairy farmer near Dysart reported the total loss of 300 acres of corn and $300,000 damage to the farm.  Several of his dairy cows perished or had to be euthanized.  The farmer said he would have to go out of the farming business after 45 years due to the extent of the loss.  In Tama County, officials reported that 1000 county road signs were destroyed by the high wind.  Meanwhile, the northern part of the system continued to produce strong winds with a 63 MPH wind ..."

PENNSYLVANIA,42,2012,May,Lightning,0,0,0,0,Department of Highways,"Severe thunderstorms produced extensive damage as they moved across the Urban Corridor.  At Denver International Airport alone, large hail up to golfball size, very heavy rain and wind gusts to 59 mph caused substantial damage to 40 planes and stranded approximately 1,500 passengers overnight.  Frontier and United Airlines were hardest hit as dozens of planes were taken out of service for repairs; forcing the cancellation of at least 220 flights over the next several days.  Damage to the aircrafts alone was nearly $5 million.   In addition, 83 cars in airport parking lots were damaged, along with some police cars and maintenance vehicles.  In Watkins, two people suffered minor injuries and 35 to 40 homes were damaged.  As many as 200 residents in a mobile home park were left homeless by the storm, forcing the Red Cross to open a shelter at Bennett High School.  The trailer park contained 52 mobile homes, 14 recreational vehicles, 3 houses and a commercial building.  Hailstones the size of softballs cratered the north sides of the mobile homes.  Some farmers in the area said they lost as much as 85 percent of their total wheat crop.  Power lines were also damaged which affected about 1,200 customers in Watkins.  The strong winds also flipped over a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 70 near Watkins Road.  Insurance claims for the Watkins, Bennett and Brighton areas was estimated to be $17 million.  The total damage estimate across the entire Urban Corridor, was $164.8 million, and included 17,200 automobile claims and 12,600 homeowner claims.||In addition, thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall, caused flash flooding in the Four Mile Canyon burn scar west of Boulder.  Three homes reportedly had water up to the windows with water flowing into structures at Fourmile Canyon Road and Gold Run Road.  The heavy rain caused a 4-ft surge along Fourmile Creek through Orodell and into the entry of Boulder Creek.  Several roads were affected which restricted access to the area.  Roads were closed due to water and debris.  Private bridges and drives were washed out and several residents were stranded and later rescued.  Numerous cars were damaged in debris flows and several structures suffered flood damage but were not destroyed."
COLORADO,8,2012,May,Lightning,0,0,0,0,Official NWS Observations,"For several hours between the mid-afternoon and late-evening on this Wednesday, a few supercell storms affected portions of South Central Nebraska. The majority of severe weather focused in two separate areas, one north of Interstate 80, and the other, more significant zone, south of Interstate 80 and west of Highway 281. Although large hail, damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall were the main issues, a pair of brief EF0 tornadoes occurred near Upland in northern Franklin County, with no damage reported. A few of the more notable hail and wind reports included golf ball size hail in southwest Furnas County and estimated 65 MPH winds in the Franklin area, with the roof of a storage shed peeled back just north of town. Rainfall wise, some of the heaviest downpours targeted Howard and Franklin Counties. Observers in the Dannebrog and St. Paul areas reported nearly 3 inches of rain, while in Franklin, 3.43 inches fell in a short time, resulting in localized flooding. After sunrise the next morning, the Thompson Creek at Riverton briefly exceeded flood stage of 10 feet. ||Focusing on timing and evolution, storms south of Interstate 80 first blossomed around 530 PM CDT as a supercell formed over Furnas County. The second and most noteworthy supercell in this southern area took shape over Kearney County around 7 PM CDT, before making a right turn southeast into Franklin County and producing the brief tornadoes. The storms north of Interstate 80 developed earlier on, first becoming strong in Howard and northern Hall Counties around 4 PM CDT. Additional storms continued to regenerate over this area, with one small supercell eventually tracking east into Merrick County around 7 PM CDT, dropping quarter size hail. All storms in South Central Nebraska weakened considerably or faded away altogether by midnight CDT.||There were both pros and cons regarding the risk for severe weather on this day. Working against a viable threat was overall weak large-scale forcing and strong capping, with only subtle shortwaves aloft rippling through west-southwest flow between a ridge dominating the southern states and a trough centered over the Pacific Northwest. On the other hand, the mesoscale environment became increasingly supportive of severe storms as the afternoon wore on, with the dominant supercells south of I-80 focused along an east-west surface front draped near the Nebraska-Kansas border. As easterly surface winds pooled considerable moisture and instability north of this boundary, mesoscale parameters during the mid-evening hours featured around 3000 J/kg MLCAPE, but only around 30 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear. However, the surface front enhanced low level shear and resultant brief tornado development, with 0-1 kilometer storm relative helicity increasing to over 200 m2/s2."

The only known report of severe weather during this event involved estimated 65 MPH winds in Rooks County. Focusing on timing and evolution, storms first pushed into Phillips and Rooks Counties between 7 and 8 PM CDT, after initiating during the mid-late afternoon hours a few counties to the west. Within an environment characterized by steep low-level lapse rates, these storms became efficient wind producers, but quickly weakened as they pushed toward and east of the Highway 281 corridor.

This storm first initiated and slowly intensified across eastern Franklin and southern Adams Counties between 530 and 630 PM CDT, and then tracked almost due northeast for several hours, finally exiting out of Merrick and Polk Counties near Silver Creek shortly after 10 PM CDT. As it tracked northeast, this storm took on characteristics of both a multicell and an outflow-dominant supercell, pulsing in intensity and occasionally undergoing splits. Estimated wind speeds reached 65 MPH at times, with some of the most noteworthy damage occurring within the city of Grand Island where large trees were uprooted in a cemetery, and a hole was blown in the roof of a fire station.||This severe storm first formed along the northern edge of a zone of steep-low level lapse rates extending out of Kansas, and in a very moist and unstable environment just north of a surface warm front. This airmass featured surface dewpoints well into the 70s, and mixed-layer CAPE values on the order of 4000 J/kg. Deep-layer vertical wind shear was quite weak, only around 20 knots or so due to the presence of weak mid and upper level flow associated with upper level ridging dominating the central and southeastern United States.

Rapidly evolving from a multicell cluster to a brief high-precipitation supercell, this storm packed quite a punch, causing considerable wind damage as it pushed along the Nebraska and Kansas border mainly between 9 PM and 1030 PM CDT, impacting southeastern Webster and especially southern Nuckolls Counties. The community of Superior and its immediate vicinity bore the brunt of severe weather, with estimated winds to at least 80 MPH causing extensive tree and crop damage and some structural damage as well. Some of this structural damage in Superior included a metal combination storage and residence building having much of its roof and one wall ripped away. In addition to damaging winds, dime to quarter size hail also affected the Superior area along with torrential rainfall estimated to around 2.5 inches that resulted in considerable street flooding. As this storm moved just east of the Superior area toward southwestern Thayer County, it rapidly started to weaken and dissipate. Although additional thunderstorms rumbled across mainly the southern-most row of South Central Nebraska counties well into the early morning hours on the 22nd, none of these became severe. ||This storm rapidly intensified around 9 PM CDT, evolving from a weak and narrow line of convection that had been drifting east along the state line for the previous few hours. This area of convection was largely detached from more widespread multicell storm activity ongoing at least 50-80 miles to the south in Kansas. The rapid intensification into a supercell was likely due to a combination of factors, including the encountering of a more unstable and less-capped airmass in the vicinity of a surface warm front. Mesoscale severe weather parameters around this time featured only marginal deep-layer vertical wind shear around 30 knots, but significant mixed-layer CAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Aloft, synoptic forcing was weak, with only subtle mid level disturbances passing through weak to modest quasi-zonal flow.

Precipitable water values increased to between 2 and 2.2 inches in a band extending from southwest into northeast Iowa as monsoonal moisture was drawn north.  CAPE values were in the 4000 to 5000 J/kg range, with the lifted index between -6 and -8 C on the warm side of the thunderstorm development.  The atmospheric shear was weak, around 20 kts.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 600 J/kg, but hail production was limited by the 15,500 foot freezing level.  Thunderstorms developed over central into east central and northeast Iowa.  Upscale development took place into a small MCS.  This MCS produced severe weather, mainly in the form of high winds and some small hail.  Damage from the wind was limited to tree damage for the most part.  One storm produced very strong winds in Butler County.  Winds with an estimated speed of 80 MPH tore part of the roof off of a house north of Aplington and also destroyed 6 outbuildings.

NEW HAMPSHIRE,33,2012,June,Tornado,0,0,0,0,Storm Chaser,"Although expectations were not high for significant severe weather in South Central Nebraska on this late Sunday afternoon and early evening, a small but intense cluster of severe storms morphed into a bow echo, producing a narrow, concentrated zone of wind damage across several southeast counties. The most intense corridor of winds estimated in the 60-70 MPH range first developed just south of Hastings around 520 PM CDT. During the next 90 minutes, damaging winds accelerated southeast through several communities including Fairfield, Deweese, Deshler, Hebron and Gilead, before exiting the area into southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas by 730 PM CDT. Most of the multiple reports of damage involved trees and power lines, including a large tree that crushed the front end of a sport utility vehicle at Fairfield in Clay County. In addition to the widespread wind damage, this storm complex dumped torrential rainfall of at least 1-2 inches in a short time. The highest-known gauge readings of 3.18 to 3.50 inches occurred just southwest of Hastings, during the early, slower-moving stages of the complex.  ||This severe-storm complex gradually evolved from a cluster of fairly disorganized multicellular storms that blossomed during the early to mid-afternoon hours near the Interstate 80 corridor between Dawson and Hamilton Counties. With time, these storms started propagating southeast along a common outflow, merging with vigorous new storm development over Adams County between 4 and 5 PM CDT. Once this occurred, a well-established cold pool took shape, and the storm cluster accelerated southeast, assuming the shape of a small bow echo in Thayer County. These severe storms were primarily ignited by the presence of a very moist and unstable airmass, characterized by surface dewpoints in the low-mid 70s and surface-based CAPE values of 4000-5000 J/kg. Synoptic-scale forcing was very minimal, with only a subtle disturbance passing through the region in quasi-zonal flow aloft. Deep-layer vertical wind shear was quite weak, only 20-30 knots at best, due to the upper air pattern featuring ridging across the southern two-thirds of the nation. The high levels of low-level moisture were focused by light easterly surface flow to the north of a somewhat diffuse surface front stretched across northern Kansas into northwest Missouri."
NEW YORK,36,2012,June,Lightning,0,0,0,0,Amateur Radio,"Although expectations were not high for severe weather in North Central Kansas on this late Sunday afternoon and early evening, two separate areas of strong to severe storms resulted in a few reports of 50 to 65 MPH winds for parts of the six-county area. First, a surge of strong to severe outflow winds charged southward into mainly Jewell and Mitchell Counties between 545 and 645 PM CDT, emanating from a small complex of severe storms centered just to the north in south central Nebraska. As this outflow crossed Jewell County, estimated gusts to 65 MPH resulted in tree damage in Mankato. Although the main track of this severe storm complex remained off to the north and east, at least one strong storm flared up in Jewell County along the surging outflow boundary. Around the time this initial activity was settling down or moving east of the area, a new smattering of strong to severe storms crept north of Interstate 70 into southern parts of Osborne, Rooks and Mitchell Counties between 7 and 830 PM CDT, resulting in 50-60 MPH winds at Natoma. ||These separate areas of severe weather resulted from different initiating mechanisms. The storms in Nebraska that pushed severe outflow southward into Jewell County developed in a moisture-rich low level environment to the north of somewhat diffuse surface front stretched across northern Kansas into northwest Missouri. Meanwhile, the severe storm that later affected Osborne County first developed along northward-pushing outflow from storms in central Kansas. These higher-based central Kansas storms formed in an environment characterized by very steep low-level lapse rates, making them conducive for pulse downbursts and damaging winds. Synoptic-scale forcing for convection was very minimal across the region, with only a subtle disturbance passing through quasi-zonal flow aloft. Deep-layer vertical wind shear was also quite weak, only around 20 knots, due to mid and upper-level ridging dominating the southern two-thirds of the nation."

MISSOURI,29,2012,July,Excessive Heat,88,0,2,0,Storm Chaser,"Between 1130 PM CDT on Wednesday the 27th and 3 AM CDT early Thursday morning the 28th, a small complex of strong to severe wind-producing thunderstorms pushed northeast across southeastern portions of South Central Nebraska, primarily affecting counties such as Webster, Franklin, Nuckolls, Clay and southern Adams. Although storm and damage reports were limited, winds of at least 55-60 MPH were reported in the Red Cloud and Blue Hill areas, with tree damage in Blue Hill. Although significant flooding issues were averted by the progressive nature of the strongest storm cores, overnight rainfall still tallied 1.5 to over 2 inches in a few spots, including 2.3 inches a few miles northeast of Blue Hill. ||Aloft, the mid and upper levels featured a typical mid-summer pattern, with South Central Nebraska positioned within the interface between a sprawling ridge across the southern states, and the primary jet stream and associated faster flow aloft across the Dakotas. The storm complex that eventually rolled into the area first evolved from a smattering of multicell storms that initiated during the late afternoon and early evening hours in central and northwest Kansas, in an environment characterized by steep low-level lapse rates and high cloud bases. As the evening wore on, these initial storms started to developed organized cold pools and push northeast across north central Kansas and into the local area, aided by convergence along a modest low level jet and weak frontal zone evident at 850 millibars. These storms already had a history of producing wind gusts of 70-80 MPH across northern Kansas before they crossed the state line.  After affecting the Red Cloud and Blue Hill areas, the storm complex weakened as it pushed northeast, and although additional rounds of thunderstorms affected parts of South Central Nebraska through the night they remained sub-severe. Mesoscale severe weather parameters around midnight CDT included approximately 2500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE, but only around 30 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear."

A few thunderstorms over the Southern Sierra Nevada had rain rates of an inch or more in an hour, and a severe thunderstorm moved over Edwards Air Force Base during the afternoon of the 30th. The warm nature of the monsoonal moisture kept central and southern San Joaquin Valley high temperatures around 100 degrees through July 30th. ||A line of thunderstorms moved through the central and southern San Joaquin Valley during the morning of July 31st, bringing record-tying rain to both Bakersfield and Fresno. After the thunderstorms moved out of the San Joaquin Valley, skies began to clear and temperatures warmed rapidly. With the cloud cover, the temperature at Fresno was between 70-72 degrees for most of the morning of the 31st. But once the clouds began to clear, the temperature warmed at a rate of 8 degrees per hour from 11 AM to 1 PM (reaching 88 degrees), and topped out at 97 degrees at 5 PM.|Both Bakersfield and Fresno were 0.6 degrees warmer than normal for July. However, July was the last month to use the 1971-2000 30-year climatological normals. The new normals, for 1981-2010, were implemented of August 1st. The new average temperature for July is slightly warmer than the 1971-2000 average. Using the new normals, July 2011 was slightly cooler than normal, with Bakersfield down 0.1 degree, and Fresno down 1.0 degree. Both Bakersfield and Fresno had 11 days with highs of 100 or above in July."

MISSISSIPPI,28,2012,July,Lightning,0,0,0,0,SHAVE Project,"A record rain event in May in eastern Montana combined with high water from storms in April and May, plus snow melt from a much above normal snow pack, all contributed to bring record high water to the Missouri River chain of reservoirs by late Spring. Then residual snow melt and additional rains produced record 13.8 million and 10.0 million acre feet of runoff above Sioux City in June and July respectively.  This helped contribute and sustain record releases from the Missouri River Reservoirs from mid June into early August.  Releases from Gavins Point Dam, which is the last in the chain, reached around 160,000 cfs by the middle of June and remained that high into early August before dropping to around 90,000 cfs by the end of the month which help alleviate some of the flooding.  The flooding continued into September but moderated greatly.   By the end of September the Omaha district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated it spent $56 million directly and indirectly in battling the river throughout its share of the basin.

This was characterized by widespread crop and pasture losses, exceptional fire risk, shortages of water in reservoirs, streams and wells creating water emergencies.  A small of area of the region from northern Tom Green County to Shackelford County received very heavy rainfall.  This area was characterized as extreme drought.  ||According to the Texas Crop Weather Report prepared by the Texas A&M Agriculture Program, the following agricultural impacts were noted across West Central Texas as extremely hot, dry, and windy conditions continued.  Normally producers would be preparing fields for fall planting but no work was being done because of the extremely dry soils.  Rangeland and pasture conditions continued to deteriorate, and producers further decreased the size of their herds while increasing the amount of supplemental feed and water hauled. Hay was in very short supply. Most small livestock operators have already completely liquidated their herds. Some larger ranches were holding on to core herds, hoping for conditions to improve.  With hay prices as high as they???ve ever been, producers were looking for feeding options.

This storm initiated in southern Howard County around 5 PM CDT and quickly became severe. As it tracked across southern Merrick and central Hamilton Counties, it briefly exhibited some enhanced rotation. Though no tornadoes occurred, a funnel cloud was reported in the Chapman area around 6 PM CDT. Just southeast of Marquette, hail up to 2 inches in diameter fell for 10 minutes. The storm exited eastern York County around 730 PM CDT, just as it was transitioning into more of a damaging wind-producer. Although this lone supercell resulted in the only reports of severe weather across the area, other strong storms raked across portions of Nance, far northeastern Merrick and far northern Polk Counties a bit later in the evening, mainly between 830 and 930 PM CDT. ||The initial supercell development late in the afternoon occurred in a very unstable mesoscale environment characterized by around 4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE, stemming from surface temperatures around 90 degrees and dewpoints in the 70s. Deep-layer vertical wind shear was also quite favorable for mid-summer, averaging 30-40 knots thanks to a seasonably strong quasi-zonal flow aloft. The primary triggering mechanism aloft for severe storm development was a modest mid-level shortwave tracking along the Nebraska-South Dakota border, while at the surface, a weak cold front gradually sagged southeastward across the area."

The airmass was quite unstable with CAPE values in the 4000-5000 J/kg range and lifted indices around -8 C.  Afternoon highs reached the upper 80s to low 90s, with dewpoints in the low to mid 70s ahead of the cold front.  Precipitable water was quite high with 1.6 to 2 inches available.  Scattered thunderstorms formed to the west of Iowa initially in a scattered line.  They coalesced into a small forward propagating MCS by the evening hours.  The airmass was moderately sheared with 40 to 45 kts of effective shear.  The freezing level was quite high, around 14,500 feet, so hail was limited.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 700 and 1100 J/kg.  The storms produced high winds as the primary mode of severe weather.  This was not too surprising considering there was 1500 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available just ahead of the MCS.  Initially the storms did produce hail as the cells were more discrete.  Dime to quarter size hail was reported in Crawford and Audubon Counties.  The system quickly became a wind event as it raced across the southern third to half of Iowa.  Winds speeds of 60 to 70 MPH were common along its path.  The highest measured wind gust was 71 MPH northwest of Creston.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed all along the path.  Damage was done to some house roofs in the town of Creston, with a tree reportedly falling onto one house in Creston.  Roof damage was also reported in Madison County with an American Legion building damaged in Macksburg.  High winds also blew a camper off of its jacks in Lucas County in Williamson.

COLORADO,8,2012,August,Drought,0,0,0,0,Broadcast Media,"The National Weather Service conducted a storm damage survey that occurred from route PR-125 to the southwest town of Moca through Barrio Cruz to route PR-111 on the east side of town. After a damage survey and eyewitness accounts, the National Weather Service determined that a tornado estimated at EF-0 on the enhanced Fujita scale affected the Cuba sector and Barrio Cruz neighborhood during the early afternoon hours of Sunday August 7th with estimated winds of 65 to 75 mph. ||The tornado formed within a cluster of severe thunderstorms that developed across the interior mountain range near Adjuntas municipality and moved rapidly northwest northwest around 20 mph through the municipalities of Lares, San Sebastian, and Moca. The small circulation of the tornado was likely caused by a small low pressure area or meso low that typically develops during the afternoons over northwest Puerto Rico during the summer months due to interaction of the west coast sea breeze and the prevailing trade winds. Depending on the magnitude of the prevailing and local winds, this meso low can create sufficient horizontal spin in the atmosphere to create small rotating columns of air to generate a tornado assuming enough moisture and instability are present. In other words...this tornado was generated|by boundary interactions and not from a typical tornadic supercell. The path of wind damage started from near PR-125 to the southwest of town and then continued for approximately 0.8 miles to the northwest through some open field and through the streets of Los Cipreses and Los Loperena where it crossed PR-125 again to near|PR-111 where the tornado was seen to have lifted up or dissipated.||The damage from the ef-0 tornado consisted of many trees snapped with a couple of them uprooted...an overturned truck parked on the street Los Cipreses, broken glass and windows to some residences and a power pole snapped. Evidence of the tornado included a video which showed a funnel cloud touching the ground with debris blowing in different directions, trees falling in a convergent pattern...eyewitness reports and leaves splattered on all four sides of structures.||The large amount of trees snapped suggests that winds within the tornado reached 65 mph while a couple of large uprooted trees indicate winds may have reached up to 75 mph. It is estimated that this tornado traveled a distance of up to 0.8 miles and lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.||The National Weather Service in San Juan issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the municipalities of San Sebastian, Moca, Aguada, Aguadilla and Isabela. A special weather statement was also issued prior to the severe thunderstorm warning highlighting the threat of strong thunderstorms with strong winds."
NEW MEXICO,35,2012,August,Thunderstorm Wind,0,0,0,0,Park/Forest Service,"Despite only a few reports of severe weather in the form of quarter size hail, multiple rounds of thunderstorms affected the six-county area on this Sunday. The first cluster of strong to severe multicell storms arrived in the morning, mainly between 830 and 11 AM CDT, before exiting eastward into northeast Kansas. A few embedded cores within the storm cluster intensified across northern portions of Smith and Jewell Counties, producing quarter size hail in Burr Oak. These storms focused along an east to west low-level frontal boundary, in the presence of around 2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and seasonably strong deep-layer vertical wind shear around 40 knots. ||Through the afternoon hours, additional storms continued to stream from west to east across parts of the area, but these remained sub-severe. Following a lull in thunderstorm activity through mid-evening, another concentrated, east to west corridor of strong to severe storms flared up across primarily Osborne and Mitchell Counties between 930 and 1130 PM CDT, before exiting off to the east. The western-most of these storms, which briefly took on characteristics of an elevated supercell, dropped quarter size hail for several minutes between Natoma and Osborne. Much like the morning storms, the mesoscale environment in the late evening featured around 2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and roughly 40 knots of deep-layer vertical shear. The corridor of storm initiation appeared to be tied to the nose of a modest 20-30 knot low level jet evident at 850 millibars. These multiple round of storms on the 7th were just one chapter in several days of active weather across the Central Plains region, as multiple weak disturbances rippled through seasonably strong quasi-zonal flow aloft stretched all the way across the central corridor of the United States."

The first strong to severe multicell storm of the event tracked nearly due east near the Interstate 80 corridor during the evening, first entering western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT, and weakening considerably by 930 PM CDT along the York-Polk County line. The only severe-criteria report along the way consisted of 60 MPH winds near Gothenburg, though gusts neared 50 MPH at the Grand Island airport. During the late evening hours, northern portions of the area narrowly missed being impacted by a fast-moving bow echo mesoscale convective system that produced damaging winds across parts of north central and northeast Nebraska. Overnight, storm coverage within South Central Nebraska increased markedly, as multiple rounds of mainly multicell clusters flared up and passed from west to east across the area. Although no severe-criteria reports were received late in the night, nickel size hail was reported in Superior, and the Hastings airport measured gusts to 51 MPH. In the end, locally heavy rainfall ended up being the main story with the overnight storms, with parts of primarily Adams, Clay, Nuckolls and Thayer Counties tallying at least 1-2 inches. ||These evening and overnight storms were just one chapter of several days of active weather within the Central Plains region, as multiple weak disturbances rippled through seasonably strong quasi-zonal flow aloft. With the main core of upper level winds directly overhead, deep-layer vertical wind shear was quite strong for early August, averaging between 40-50 knots.

LAKE ERIE,95,2012,August,Marine Thunderstorm Wind,0,0,0,0,WLON,"This early Tuesday evening featured the most noteworthy hail event of 2011 within this six-county area of North Central Kansas, as a pair of outflow-dominant supercells tracked southeast through portions of western Phillips, Rooks and Osborne Counties, producing hail up to softball size. The leading edge of the storms first entered southwest Phillips County near Logan shortly after 630 PM CDT, eventually exiting the area southward into central Kansas by around 830 PM. During these two hours, large hail between the size of ping pong balls and baseballs pounded several communities including Logan, Stockton, Plainville, Zurich, Damar and Palco. In Zurich, some stones were reported to be softball size. Damage reports included multiple broken windows on homes and vehicles, along with battered siding. Although large hail was the main story, damaging winds occurred in some areas as well, with reports including a few downed trees in Stockton and snapped power poles south of Alton. In addition, locally heavy rain of around 2 inches fell in parts of the area from a combination of these early evening storms and other storms that arrived later in the night, with unofficial reports of over 4 inches south of Plainville near the Ellis County line. ||This fairly concentrated bout of severe weather in Phillips, Rooks and Osborne Counties was only a small segment of a much larger northwest to southeast corridor of hail and wind that stretched hundreds of miles from southeast Wyoming to south central Kansas. Over the course of several hours lasting well into the early morning hours on the 10th, multiple supercells and multicell clusters tracked southeast along this corridor. Fortunately for this portion of North Central Kansas, the early evening storms were the only ones to impart a significant impact, as several other severe storms narrowly passed south and west of the area during the late evening and overnight hours. Between midnight and 3 AM CDT, another complex of strong storms raked across much of Phillips, Rooks and Osborne Counties, but these were reportedly not severe. ||The initial early evening hail-producing supercells had been taking aim on North Central Kansas for several hours, first becoming severe in west central Nebraska during the early afternoon as they tracked nearly due southeast. The synoptic and mesoscale environment was quite supportive of this type of northwest flow severe event, with early evening parameters featuring unseasonably strong deep layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots, along with mixed-layer CAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg. The strong west-northwest flow aloft was directed along the far southern periphery of a deep low pressure system crossing Ontario. At the surface, North Central Kansas was positioned near a west-northwest to east-southeast oriented quasi-stationary front, with low level easterly flow helping to enhance shear parameters."

NEW MEXICO,35,2012,August,High Wind,0,0,0,0,Newspaper,"Between 11 PM CDT on Thursday the 11th and 8 AM on Friday the 12th, two separate strong to severe quasi-linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS) punched south across roughly the northeast one-third of South Central Nebraska, primarily affecting locations east of a line from Ord to Aurora to Geneva. While both systems were similar in character, the second one packed more of a wallop, as a fairly localized area of wind damage occurred in parts of Merrick and Hamilton Counties between 600-630 AM, mainly affecting the Central City, Aurora and Hordville areas. Especially hard-hit by these early morning storms was the Willow Bend Lake area south of Central City, where several large trees were blown down, including one 90-feet tall that clipped the corner of a home. As the winds surged southward, a gust to 70 MPH was measured at the Aurora airport. No reports of wind damage were received as the leading edge of these storms continued southeast through the York and Geneva areas. This early morning MCS first entered the far northern counties of South Central Nebraska around 5 AM. ||Several hours prior to the pre-dawn wind damage, an earlier MCS passed through almost the same counties, first affecting locations from Ord to Genoa around 11 PM CDT, and eventually exiting counties along the Highway 81 corridor around 2 AM. Although no severe-criteria winds or hail were reported with this first round, a peak gust of 54 MPH was measured at the Ord airport. In addition to strong winds and generally small hail, both systems dumped locally heavy rainfall. Storm total amounts were commonly 1.25-2.50 inches and locally higher, including 2.98 inches in Nance County west of Fullerton, and 2.68 inches at Wolbach. ||Both systems that passed through South Central Nebraska initially organized and strengthened near the Nebraska-South Dakota border, before rolling southeast. The synoptic and mesoscale environment was supportive of regenerative MCS formation. Overnight parameters featured around 40 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear, and 1000-2000 J/KG most-unstable CAPE, with instability fed by warm-air advection along the nose of a roughly 30 knot low level jet at 850 millibars.

Although no storm reports met severe-criteria, there were instances of nickel size hail and 50 MPH winds. Locally heavy rainfall ended up being the main story, with several locations near the Highway 136 corridor tallying between 1.25-2.50 inches, and locally higher. A few of the highest-known gauge readings included 3.00 inches four miles east of Red Cloud and 2.78 inches eight miles northwest of Superior.||Storms first spread into southern Harlan County around 8 PM CDT, expanding northward from a line of convection that had been ongoing in parts of northwest and north central Kansas for a few hours. These initial Kansas storms blossomed near a surface warm front and within a zone of steep low-level lapse rates, as a weak shortwave moved in from the southwest. Between 830 and 930 PM CDT, storms quickly expanded east of Harlan County, with the trailing edge of the strongest convection exiting eastern Thayer County around 11 PM. As the storm complex tracked along and near the Highway 136 corridor, mesoscale parameters featured around 2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and deep-layer vertical wind shear on the order of 30-40 knots.

With both rounds, the strongest and western-most individual storm within the complex mainly affected Valley County, with the morning event resulting in estimated winds up to 60 MPH in Arcadia, and damage to crops from wind and hail north of Arcadia. Six miles north of Arcadia, 1.80 inches of rain fell in roughly 30 minutes. This initial round of storms first pushed in from the north around 830 AM CDT, with the strongest storm rapidly weakening along the Sherman-Howard County line around 1030 AM. The second storm complex, which was very similar to the first but somewhat weaker, entered Valley County from the north around 12 PM, with the strongest storm eventually dissipating over Merrick County around 130 PM. No storm reports were received from this second round.||Both complexes of storms first organized across far north central Nebraska, and were primarily driven by low to mid level warm air advection, near the nose of a weak southwesterly low level jet evident at 850 millibars. These storms were focused on the northeast edge of an instability gradient, with most-unstable CAPE likely averaging under 1000 J/kg. On the larger scale, storm generation was focused along the southwest periphery of a mid level low passing through the northern Great Lakes region.

NEW HAMPSHIRE,33,2012,September,Flood,0,0,0,0,Other Federal Agency,"Irene was a quite large and impressive tropical wave during most of its journey across the Atlantic Ocean during the week of August 14-20, 2011. For most of this time the wave was nearly surrounded by dry air and with enough vertical wind shear to ensure that any intensification would be slow. Its forward speed of 20 mph somewhat aided the shear in keeping it weak. Irene made landfall over mainland Puerto Rico at 125 am AST on August 22, near Punta Santiago then Luis Munoz Marin International Airport at San Juan recorded its highest wind gust of 59 mph at 218 am AST.  At 300 am AST (0700 UTC) the center was estimated to be 10 miles southwest of San Juan with 70 mph sustained winds, mainly over the Atlantic waters north of the city.||By 500 am AST doppler radar had indicated winds sustained up to 72 knots (83 mph) only 500 to 600 feet above the water. Irene was then officially upgraded to a hurricane though a hurricane warning had already been issued for the region. With the hurricane center moving offshore about this time the strongest winds (north of the center) also moved away from shore. At 536 am AST the buoy near Arecibo recorded its highest wind gust of 37 knots (43 mph). At 900 am AST the center of Irene was directly north of the west coast of Puerto Rico but the hurricane force winds were well offshore with an obviously developing eye on radar.||Puerto Rico was under the effects of Tropical Cyclone Irene from early Sunday August 22 through late Wednesday August 24. Irene made landfall as a tropical storm during the early morning hours of Monday August 22, intensified overland and became a hurricane over northern Puerto Rico around 500 am Monday, before exiting into the Atlantic later that morning. Irene???s most siginificant impact was the heavy rainfall. The first rainbands entered eastern Puerto Rico early on Sunday and persisted through midnight on Wednesday, although additional rainfall was received across some of the east municipalities through Thursday morning August 25. Locations like Gurabo across eastern interior Puerto Rico experienced significant 48 hour rainfall accumulations, with an estimated return period of around 50 years.||Shortly after Irene???s center passed by San Juan on August 22 there were 800,000 homes without electric power and 118,000 without water service. The storm surge from Irene, as expected, was very minor. The highest surges measured were at Esperanza (Vieques) and Fajardo and reached 1.6 feet between 100 am and 200 am (0506z and 0530z respectively). This was during the time that the center of Irene was moving inland over Eastern Puerto Rico.||Damage from flooding was extensive across the region from Irene, however, though wind caused widespread damage it was relatively minor compared to a more significant hurricane. Numerous trees were blown down very early on Monday morning from Fajardo to San Juan Metro. Downed trees were reported to block highways in Gurabo, Adjuntas, Caguas while a down power pole lay on Highway PR-176 in Cupey.||On August 27 Puerto Rico had been declared a major disaster area, and by September 3 additional municipalities were added to provide aid to those impacted, and still more on September 13. In all, there were 29 municipalities approved for individual assistance to individuals and households while 37 municipalities were designated for public assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities."

Rainfall amounts generally averaged 4 to 8 inches. Much of the rain which fell occurred within a 12 hour period, beginning early Sunday morning, and ending Sunday evening. ||This heavy to extreme rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding across southern Vermont. In Bennington County, widespread flash flooding and associated damage was reported countywide, with many roads closed due to flooding and downed trees and power lines. Route 9, the main route across southern Vermont, was closed. The city of Bennington was inaccessible for a period of time. Record flooding occurred on the Walloomsac River at Bennington. ||In Windham County, catastrophic flooding was reported countywide, along with widespread damage and road closures. Route 9, the main route across southern Vermont was closed, with the city of Wilmington inaccessible for a period of time. Numerous evacuations were reported. In addition, record flooding occurred on the Saxtons River at Saxtons and the Williams River at Rockingham.||One death occurred due to flooding from Irene in southern Vermont. In Windham County, a woman drowned when the car she was in became trapped by flood waters from the Deerfield River in Wilmington. ||Strong winds also occurred across southern Vermont, with frequent wind gusts of 35 to 55 mph, along with locally stronger wind gusts exceeding 60 mph. The strongest winds occurred from the north to northeast during the morning hours, then from the west to northwest during Sunday evening. The combination of strong winds, and extremely saturated soil led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region.

NEW JERSEY,34,2012,October,High Wind,2,0,3,0,Emergency Manager,"A record rain event in May in eastern Montana combined with high water from other storms in April and May, plus snow melt from a much above normal snow pack, to bring record high water to the Missouri River chain of reservoirs by late Spring. Then residual snow melt and additional rains caused record 13.8 million and 10.0 million acre feet of runoff above Sioux City during June and July respectively. All of this helped contribute and sustain record releases from the Missouri River Reservoirs from mid June into early August. Releases from Gavins Point Dam, which is the last in the chain, reached around 160,000 cfs by the middle of June and remained that high into early August before dropping to around 90,000 cfs by the end of that month. The releases were then held steady for several weeks in early September to help avoid sloughing of water-logged levees. So although flooding continued into September at many points along the river, it moderated greatly.  At the floods peak in western Iowa 46 miles of Interstate 29 were closed due to flooding and around 250,000 acres of farmland were inundated.

Then residual snow melt and additional rains caused record 13.8 million and 10.0 million acre feet of runoff above Sioux City during June and July respectively.  All of this helped contribute and sustain record releases from the Missouri River Reservoirs from mid June into early August.  Releases from Gavins Point Dam, which is the last in the chain, reached around 160,000 cfs by the middle of June and remained that high into early August before dropping to around 90,000 cfs by the end of that month. The releases were then held steady for several weeks in early September to help avoid sloughing of water-logged levees.

MONTANA,30,2012,November,High Wind,0,0,0,0,Park/Forest Service,"Tropical Depression 13 formed on the evening of September 1, 2011 about 225 miles southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The depression moved very slowly, around 2 mph, across northern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. Through mid day on the 2nd, Tropical Depression 13 remained mostly stationary over the northern Gulf of Mexico, drenching Louisiana with several inches of rain. Around 1 pm on the 2nd, the depression was found to have strengthened to Tropical Storm strength by both Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft and local observations on oil rigs, becoming the 12th named storm of 2011. Tropical Storm Lee as it was named, had moved little and was located about 210 miles to the southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Maximum sustained winds of 40 mph were found with the newly named tropical storm and a minimum central pressure of 1003 mb.||Lee continued to move very slowly on the 2nd and 3rd, while heavy rain and strong winds continued to lash southern Louisiana. By mid day on the 3rd, Lee stalled south of the Louisiana coast with sustained winds around 60 mph. Lee continued to meander just along or south of the Louisiana coast through the remainder of the day on the 3rd. During the early morning hours of the 4th, Tropical Storm Lee finally made landfall near Vermillion Bay, LA, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 45 mph. However, Lee was still moving very slowly to the north northeast, dumping large quantities of rain and spawning tornadoes across portions of southern Louisiana, southeastern Mississippi and other portions of the Gulf Coast. ||As the center of Lee continued to trek northward, heavy rain bands spiraled across much of central Mississippi producing significant flooding issues. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 10 inches were common across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area, with a few locations reporting amounts of 10 to 13 inches. Significant flash flooding was reported in the Jackson metro area, along with a few locations in southern Mississippi. Reports from emergency manager officials indicated that at least 50 homes, 60 apartment units and several other buildings were flooded by Monday morning. Numerous vehicles in the Jackson area were flooded, primarily in low-lying parking spots. Dozens of roads and bridges were washed out in central Mississippi. U.S. Highway 80 and Interstate 20 east of Jackson were both closed due to high water. Locations in the Mississippi Delta, northeast Louisiana and southeast Arkansas saw the least amount of rainfall, with amounts generally ranging from one half of an inch to 2 inches. Rivers responded to the large volume of rain, with many points on the Pearl River rising to minor to low-end moderate flooding. Other smaller creeks also came close to flood stage. ||In addition to the significant rainfall and flooding, tornadoes also occurred with Tropical Storm Lee. Four confirmed tornadoes occurred in the Jackson County Warning Area. As is the case with most tropical systems, these tornadoes were very brief and fairly weak. Much of the damage was EF-0 type damage, with mostly trees and limbs coming down. The strongest tornado was rated EF-1 near Collins, MS. Some structural damage occurred along with tree damage. This tornado tracked for 3 miles with maximum estimated winds at 90 mph.||Around 10pm on September 4th, Lee was downgraded to a Tropical Depression with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. However, these winds were occurring well to the south and southeast of the center out over the Gulf of Mexico. The weakened cyclone was located about 55 miles to the west southwest of McComb, MS. The remnants of Lee got caught up with an approaching cold front and moved quickly to the northeast, dumping rainfall on the Mid-Atlantic region that was doused by Hurricane Irene only a week prior.||Select rainfall totals(inches) from across central Mississippi include Florence, MS(13.55), Forest, MS(12.82), Walnut Grove(12.59), 8mi south Phila..."

CONNECTICUT,9,2012,November,Winter Weather,0,0,0,0,CoCoRaHS,"Tropical Storm Lee began as a tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea during the last week of August. By the evening of Thursday, 1 September 2011, the tropical wave further developed into Tropical Depression 13. By 1 PM the following Friday afternoon, Tropical Depression Lee had formed. Lee slowly moved northward towards the south central Louisiana coastline by Saturday afternoon 3 September, while continuing to produce extremely heavy rainfall over portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the northwest Florida Panhandle. ||The outer rain-bands of Lee produced near-continuous heavy rainfall over portions of southern Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and the northwestern Florida Panhandle by early Saturday morning and that endured through early Sunday before dry air aloft wrapped into Lee???s western side. The center of Lee moved over land around sunrise Sunday, 4 September. However, it would be a while before Lee would weaken to a depression because it remained nearly stationary while the southern half of the circulation was over water where it could continue to derive additional energy from the warm ocean. The next day, Lee was eventually picked up by an upper air trough, turned northeastward and resumed a faster forward speed late in the day on Sunday, 4 September as it began its welcome exit to the northeast late Sunday through late Monday.||Lee???s impacts were far reaching across our region. Although the continuous rains became somewhat intermittent as dry air wrapped into Lee from the west, this created a situation from Sunday afternoon through midday Monday whereby individual thunderstorms became more intense due to increasing levels of atmospheric instability. Stronger thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes affected the North Central Gulf Coast Region, as they formed within the detached outer spiral rain-bands well to the east of Lee???s center on Sunday and finally to the southeast on Monday. The highest total storm tide levels (astronomical plus surge effects) ranged from approximately 3.5 to just barely over 5 feet.||While Lee was in the process of being picked up by a fast moving upper air trough, a series of squall lines that produced moderately widespread thunderstorm wind damage along and ahead of the surface cold front, as well as more isolated tornadoes, affected the area through late Monday afternoon. In all, some 10 to 15 inches of rain fell along coastal sections of Alabama and northwest Florida. Additionally, several weak tornadoes occurred producing modest structural and tree damage. There was also moderate beach erosion and the rip currents endured over a multi-day period. Inland flooding was exacerbated along the immediate coastal zone by higher tide levels due to Lee???s surge effects which created poor to no drainage of area coastal rivers, bays and sounds on during astronomical high tide cycles from 3-5 September (late night hours each day)."

CONNECTICUT,9,2012,November,High Wind,0,0,0,0,Amateur Radio,"A fairly widespread outbreak of severe thunderstorms occurred on Labor Day across much of the NWS Tallahassee County Warning Area (CWA).  This event was forced by unseasonably strong wind fields associated with a potent extra-tropical cyclone that was formerly Tropical Storm Lee.  Post-tropical cyclone Lee was moving slowly toward the east-northeast along the north central Gulf Coast during the morning hours of September 5, 2011.  By 3:00 pm EDT (1900 UTC), the cyclone was centered near Mobile Bay.  It was at this point that the system finally began to accelerate off to the northeast.  While tornadoes were initially considered to be the primary threat, examination of a special 1800 UTC KTAE sounding showed that low level winds had veered and that the flow was unidirectional through a deep layer.  WFO Tallahassee coordinated with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to replace the existing tornado watch with a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:00 pm EDT (2000 UTC).  WFO Tallahassee issued a total of 35 convective warnings during the event along with several special marine warnings.  A total of 52 severe weather reports were received across southeast Alabama, southwest and south central Georgia, and the Florida panhandle and big bend.  ||Aside from the severe weather, the forecast area experienced other peripheral impacts from post-tropical storm Lee. Widespread storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was measured across the Florida panhandle and big bend, with 1 to 2 inch totals more common across the Alabama and Georgia portions of the CWA.  The Apalachicola and Cedar Key tide gauges showed that tidal departures ran just over 2 feet above normal along the Florida big bend coastline during the high tide cycle of Tuesday morning, September 6. For the most part, flooding was avoided. The water rose up to the top of the sea walls in Dixie County, and there was some minor flooding in Wakulla County where the emergency manager reported about a 2-inch over-wash in St. Marks on Old Fort Rd.  The pressure gradient associated with Post-Tropical Storm Lee produced occasional strong wind gusts across Wakulla county for around 10 hours.  These strong wind gusts, combined with periods of heavy rain and wet soils, led to numerous trees and power lines falling throughout the day and into the evening hours.  The emergency manager reported a total of 16 trees down and 28 power lines down by the end of the day.  Of those 28 power lines, 10 of them sparked fires as a result of blowing down."

OKLAHOMA,40,2012,November,Thunderstorm Wind,0,0,0,0,AWOS,"Tropical Storm Lee formed from a persistent low pressure area off the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts on the south side of a mammoth subtropical ridge centered across the eastern Ohio valley.  This occurred during the late few days of August.  The system slowly intensified under weak steering currents and moved onshore the Louisiana coast on the 3rd.  Tropical Storm Lee was extremely slow moving at this point and consequently dumped excessive rainfall across southeast Louisiana.  A sharp upper trough began to take shape in the central U.S. on September 4th as upper energy dug southeast from Canada.  As this occurred, the remnants of Lee began to accelerate northeastward in association with the advancing upper trough.  The remnants of Lee traveled very quickly along the advancing front, racing across Georgia on the 5th.  Rain bands began to affect the area late on the 4th, but most of these were light to moderate.  On the 5th, persistent heavy rain impacted northwest Georgia and resulted in minor flooding.  Despite widespread rainfall of four to five inches across northwest Georgia with localized six to eight inches, the ongoing drought across the state resulted in minimal impacts of the heavy rain on the area,  The bigger problems came during the afternoon of the 5th when an area of strong shear, associated with the remnants of Lee, tracked from southwest to northeast across the area.  This combined with an unstable atmosphere as breaks in the clouds allowed temperatures to warm into the lower 80s.  Numerous strong thunderstorm cells developed quickly and tracked first from the Columbus area and west central Georgia into northeast Georgia.  Strong mesocyclones were indicated in many of these cells and prompted dozens of tornado warnings.  However, only one thunderstorm cell actually netted a tornado, which caused considerable damage in Cherokee county, just northwest of Atlanta.||As the outer remnant feeder bands moved away from the area during the mid-evening, the remnant core of Tropical Storm Lee passed by just to the west across northwest Alabama.  A two to three hour window of strong winds gusting to 35 to 40 mph were observed in several northwest Georgia counties as this occurred causing damage to dozens of trees and a number of power lines during this time frame."

MICHIGAN,26,2012,November,Winter Weather,0,0,0,0,Public,"The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee that interacted with a stalled frontal boundary produced several days with periods of heavy rain across New Jersey from the 5th into the 8th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 8 inches, with lesser amounts in Atlantic, Cape May and eastern Ocean Counties. The heavy rain caused renewed flooding mainly to the west and northwest of the New Jersey Turnpike corridor with mainly moderate flooding along the main stem of the Delaware River with moderate to major flooding in the Passaic and Raritan Basins. Crests were higher on the Delaware River than with Irene as many sites had their highest crests since late June of 2006. The crests along the Delaware River were 2 to 4 feet higher than what occurred during Irene. Elsewhere, nearly all crests were lower than what occurred during Irene. Most of the reported damage occurred in counties bordering the Delaware River as 2 homes were destroyed, 24 suffered major damage, 249 suffered minor damage and 28 others were affected. There were approximately 1,000 people evacuated; other than Morris County, most of the other evacuations occurred in counties bordering the Delaware River. Throughout the state 162 roads were closed due to flooding. The freshwater surge also helped cause moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River. Preliminary statewide damage was estimated at around 11.5 million dollars. The heavy rain and flooding also took its toll on crops. Farmers reported up to seventy-five percent losses of their pumpkin and tomato crops.||The combination of fresh water runoff and a weak southerly flow produced moderate tidal flooding during the evening high tide cycles from the 7th through the 9th and minor tidal flooding with all of the other high tide cycles from the evening of the 6th through overnight on the 11th. The highest tides occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 8th.  In Burlington County, tidal flooding was reported in Delran and Cinnaminson.

Showers and thunderstorms from that approaching cold front arrived during the evening and overnight on the 5th  and set off the first round of flash flooding rains in Northwest New Jersey.  The front then stalled just south of Delmarva on the 6th. A relative lull in the rain then occurred during the morning of the 6th.

TEXAS,48,2012,December,Hail,0,0,0,0,Fire Department/Rescue,"A dry southwest flow aloft set up over the area on the 6th along the leading edge of a upper level trough over the Pacific Northwest and northern California, bringing dry weather through the 8th. However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs.

By the following day the depression was upgraded and named Tropical Storm Maria at 1100 am AST, the 13th named storm of the season, while it was moving rapidly westward. At 11 pm AST on Thursday September 8 a tropical storm watch was issued for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. At 5 am AST September 9 a tropical storm warning was issued for the U.S. Virgin Islands, and at 11 am the warning was extended for Puerto Rico. Maximum winds in Maria remained between 40 mph and 50 mph for several days. On Sunday, September 11, an air force reconnaissance aircraft reported that it was becoming better organized, just 65 mi  northeast of Saint John Island. The U.S. Virgin Islands experienced breezy to windy conditions for 3 days while Maria was not far away, but not to a level of causing significant damage. The maximum winds recorded at locations where at least 25 mph. Rather than the large scale strong winds usually found in tropical storms the most intense wind on these islands often occurred during rain squalls, when showers force winds aloft to sink towards the surface. This caused the strongest sustained wind recorded during this event. The Saint Thomas airport recorded a maximum sustained southerly wind of 33 mph with gusts to 48 mph at 1 pm AST on September 12th, the rest of the  recorded winds across the U.S. Virgin Islands were of lesser strength.  On September 12 bands of heavy showers were developing in the moist ???tail??? of Maria, focusing mainly on the U.S. Virgin Islands. The slow movement of Maria, the moist tail being dragged along towards the south, and the mountain terrain of across Puerto Rico would prove to be a fateful combination, especially on the night of the 12th and morning of the 13th. Puerto Rico had devastating flooding rain for the third time in 6 weeks, following Tropical Storm Emily and Tropical Storm/Hurricane Irene, and after the extraordinarily rainy summer of 2011. Early on September 13 Maria was located north of the west end of Puerto Rico. There were developing rain bands that extended west to east, up the central mountain range in Puerto Rico, and also on the south side of the Luquillo Mountains at the eastern portion of the island. Most soils across Puerto Rico were already saturated from an extraordinarily wet summer including rain from two other tropical storms in the previous 6 weeks. Rain became the major problem as Maria became almost stationary on September 13. Rainfall accumulations were between 4 to 6 inches with locally higher amounts of up to 10 inches. The hardest hit communities were on the southern slopes of Puerto Rico including the communities along the larger rivers with headwaters in the south and south central sections of the island.  Larger river basins such as the Rio de la Plata, Rio Grande de Loiza, Rio Grande de Arecibo and Rio Grande de Manati and their tributaries showed significant rises with minor to moderate flooding reported.  The smaller basins along the southern slopes experienced flash flooding with the high intensity rainfall.  Residents in the communities of Juana Diaz, Salinas and Ponce experienced some of the highest flows of the past few years especially on Rivers Toa Vaca and Jacaguas.

An upper-level low that formed in the Gulf of Alaska dropped down the lee side of the trough, carving a stronger system that brought much colder air, thunderstorms, heavy rain and gusty winds beginning October 4th.||By the second day of the month, the computer models had been consistently showing an early-season winter storm to occur over the region with the arrival of the trough. Consequently, a Winter Storm Watch was issued for the Southern Sierra Nevada on October 2nd for three days later.||Cold air moved into the central California interior on the 4th, with the high at Fresno down 7 degrees from the previous day, and Bakersfield down 5 degrees.

The cold air over the San Joaquin Valley slowly mixed out, and by the 8th, central and southern San Joaquin Valley highs were back in the mid 70s. Temperatures continued to warm the next day, to within a few degrees of normal, as an upper-level ridge strengthened over the eastern Pacific, pushing the upper-level trough east of California. The warming was capped, however, on the 10th, as an upper-level short-wave trough tracked through British Columbia.||An upper-level trough dropping out of the Gulf of Alaska moved into the Pacific Northwest and northern California on October 10th. This system brought a few sprinkles to the central and southern San Joaquin Valley, and up to a quarter-inch of rain to the Southern Sierra Nevada with the heaviest rain falling on Yosemite National Park. Rain fell the length of the Sierra Nevada, with a hundredth of an inch falling as far south as Lake Isabella. Even the Tehachapi Mountains saw light rain, with 0.01 inch falling on Grapevine Peak.||Temperatures cooled with the arrival of the trough, with central and south Valley highs in the upper 70s to lower 80s on October 10th. Temperatures warming into the lower to mid 80s the next day as the upper-level ridge rebounded over California. There was little change in Valley temperatures on the 12th due to a thin layer of marine air that spilled through the Sacramento Delta, but the mountains saw strong warming as the ridge continued to strengthen.||An upper-level low off the California coast deepened the marine layer on October 16th, with marine air spilling into the San Joaquin Valley. The low merged with an east-Pacific trough that moved into the Pacific Northwest and flattened the ridge over California. Temperatures warmed to above normal on the 18th ahead of the trough, but as the ridge flattened, temperatures fell back to near normal, with little change through the 21st.

This resulted in the development of two intense updrafts and formation of a pair of funnel clouds, one which briefly touched down over open wheat fields in northern Whitman County.

NORTH CAROLINA,37,2013,January,High Wind,0,0,0,0,WLON,"Ending a stretch of 2.5 weeks of bone-dry weather, and also ending a streak of nearly six weeks with no severe thunderstorms in the 24-county area, this Friday afternoon and evening featured a concentrated corridor of strong to severe storms and heavy rainfall mainly across western portions of South Central Nebraska. These storms forced delays or cancellations to a number of high school football games during what turned into a fairly prolonged event, with wind and hail-producing storms first flaring up around 230 PM CDT, and finally diminishing in intensity around 1 AM. The majority of severe storms and heavy rainfall regenerated for several hours within a narrow southwest-northeast oriented corridor only about 30 miles wide at most, primarily impacting counties such as Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo, Howard, Hall and northwest Adams. The storm mode was a mixed bag of quasi-discrete, fast moving supercells and small multicell bowing segments. Storm reports included several instances of damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of golf balls. A few of the more notable reports were from Atlanta in Phelps County, including golf ball size hail and significant wind damage to the roof of a grain storage building. At the Holdrege airport, two separate storms produced measured gusts to around 60 MPH, several hours apart from one another. Although a few storms exhibited low-level rotation, no tornadoes occurred. ||Heavy rainfall-wise, parts of primarily eastern Furnas, northwest Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo and southeast Sherman Counties measured 3-6 inches of rain during this event, including 5.94 inches northwest of Oxford and 5.33 inches in Loomis. Kearney Regional Airport established a record for the date with 2.29 inches. Although the heaviest rain associated with this low pressure system fell during these storms on the afternoon and evening of the 7th, additional rain throughout the weekend boosted 3-day totals into the 6-7 inch range for some areas, highlighted by 7.13 inches at Loomis. Fortunately, due to the very dry conditions leading up to this event, widespread flooding impacts were held to a minimum. ||On the synoptic scale, the primary trigger for severe weather was the approach of a highly amplified mid-level trough across the western United States, anchored by a closed low swinging through the Four Corners region. Downstream from this low, a corridor of strong, nearly unidirectional south-southwest winds was in place in the mid and upper levels. At the surface, storm development focused along a quasi-stationary front, which at mid-afternoon stretched from eastern South Dakota to southwest Kansas. Given that winds aloft were largely parallel to this southwest-northeast oriented surface front, convection was able to focus within the aforementioned narrow corridor, with individual storms within the corridor racing northeast. Mesoscale parameters at early evening revealed only modest instability, with mixed-layer CAPE values only around 1000 J/kg, but in the presence of very strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots. Although low-level shear ramped up as the evening progressed, with 0-1 kilometer shear values increasing to 30-40 knots, the combination of increasing low level convective inhibition and multiple storm mergers likely helped mitigate a potential tornadic threat."

NEW HAMPSHIRE,33,2013,January,Strong Wind,0,0,0,0,Coast Guard,"In what would end up being the final round of strong thunderstorms of the 2011 convective season in South Central Nebraska, this late Tuesday afternoon and evening featured several storms producing sub-severe hail up to penny size across the eastern half of the area. Although the coverage of multicell storm clusters became fairly widespread during the evening hours, the majority of small hail reports were concentrated in portions of Webster, Polk and Hall Counties. Near Rosemont, and also several miles north of Osceola, copious amount of pea to dime size hail partially covered the ground. The first strong storms flared up around 430 PM CDT, with activity gradually expanding eastward through the evening hours. Although the occurrence of small hail lessened after 8 PM, storms didn't completely exit far eastern counties near the Highway 81 corridor until after 2 AM on the 12th. Rainfall wise, most areas registered no more than 0.25 to 0.75-inch, although observers in eastern portions of York and Nance Counties reported amounts in excess of 1 inch, including 1.70 inches near Waco. ||Although the potential existed for a few of these storms to become marginally severe given the presence of around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE mainly early in the event, weak deep-layer vertical wind shear only around 25 knots kept storm organization to a minimum. Aloft, the primary triggering mechanism was a modest mid-level shortwave swinging through the Plains.

The snow began just after midnight and ended during the evening, leaving a widespread 3 to 8 inches of accumulation with as much as 10 to 12 inches reported over many higher elevations and ridge tops. Despite snowfall rates between 1-2 per hour with convective enhancement in heavier bands, marginally-cold air temperatures in the low to mid 30s combined with warm road/ground temperatures and wetness of the snow reduced accumulations in some areas particularly in the central and southern valleys. Like most early-season snow events, elevation played a significant role in storm total accumulations. ||A 1010mb low pressure system centered near the Carolina coast during the predawn hours rapidly intensified to as it moved northward just offshore the Mid-Atlantic coast. The storm became a classic Nor'easter and deepened to 984mb as it passed east of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The strengthening low produced wind gusts between 20-30 mph over eastern Pennsylvania and gusts near hurricane force over the open ocean waters near the southern New England coast and Gulf of Maine.||In most locations in central Pennsylvania, observed snowfall accumulations set all-time daily and monthly snowfall records for October. The heavy, wet snow produced widespread damage to trees and utility wires. This resulted in more than a half-million (520,000) power outages state-wide at the height of the storm. Warming shelters were opened to accommodate the power outages. Several secondary roads were closed due to the downed trees and wires. The weight of the snow (snow to liquid ratios generally less than 10:1) along with remaining leaf foliage contributed to the significant tree damage.

Dry Creek was wet and looked like a lake all the way to Chicken Hill. Waves crashed over the Nome seawall armor rock on East Front Street and deposited rocks, driftwood and other debris on the road. Water running into wet wells at the Sewer and water treatment plant overwhelmed the pumps, causing 165,000 gallons of raw wastewater flow into the emergency discharge to the small boat harbor. Some businesses on Front Street had water in their basements, but flooding in the main business district was minor. The Cape Nome Jetty sustained $500,000 worth of damage and another $80,000 is attributed to damages due to wave action and erosion, according to the City of Nome. Portions of the Nome-Council road suffered significant damage, especially beyond mile 25 where large portions of the road were either washed out or covered in a significant amount of debris. It is estimated that the damages to the road alone were approximately 24 million dollars. The storm caused schools in Nome to close early on the 8th and they were shut on the 9th.

The wetter than normal conditions that began in the fall continued into December with one of the wettest Decembers on record. These increased moisture conditions improved the drought. No areas showed D4 (Exceptional) drought across the area. All other areas were further reduced, with much of the area in D3 and D2 (Severe) with D0 (Abnormally Dry) over Hall County.||2011 ended up being one of the driest or the driest year on record for many locations despite ending on a wet note. Several storm systems affected the West Texas region with significant snowfall on the 24th-25th. The areas that experienced record dryness were about 30% of normal for precipitation amounts. Some of these record locations include 4.84 inches at Brownfield (Terry County) and Plains (Yoakum County), 5.23 inches at Tahoka (Lynn County), 5.86 inches at Lubbock (Lubbock County), and 5.87 inches at Levelland (Hockley County). Keetch-Byram Drought Index values had further decreased through the month of December ranging from 300 over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle to 600 over the southwestern South Plains.||Agricultural and livestock losses were much lower than seen in previous months. Winter wheat was in fair condition with producers able to turn cattle on it for grazing by the end of December. Livestock producers continued to provide some supplemental feed. Cooler temperatures with significant rain and snowfall resulted in suppressed fire weather activity. The recent precipitation began to boost stock ponds and smaller watering holes while the larger water systems had yet to respond with any notable improvements.||Economic losses due to drought through December since the drought began were estimated near $2.3 billion."

Most areas received well above normal precipitation for the month.  In fact, many areas received record or near record precipitation totals for the month.  One area that missed out was portions of northwestern New Mexico, though these areas have not yet entered drought status.  This is mainly due to the northwest plateau being the wettest area of the state in 2011, receiving 96 percent of normal precipitation.  On the other hand, the southeast plains were the driest area of the state, at about 50 percent of normal.  Statewide average precipitation during 2011 was 73 percent of normal, making 2011 the driest year since 2003 and the sixth driest on record since the mid 1890s.  ||Despite the above normal precipitation in December, much of the state remained in drought status.  Most areas, however, did drop a category. The northeast plains, central valleys and southwest mountains dropped from extreme (D3) drought to severe (D2) drought status. Meanwhile, the exceptional (D4) drought across the southeast dropped to extreme (D3) drought status.

This continued through December 2nd.||December began with an upper-level trough over the region and a low pressure center over the Desert Southwest. Northeast winds flowed around the low and knocked over numerous power line poles and trees throughout the central San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra Nevada foothills and Yosemite National Park. Fresno was also hit hard by power outages due to downed poles; this prompted a local emergency in the city during the afternoon of the 1st. Fresno County reported about $2 million in damages due to the strong winds. Mariposa County and especially near the town of Mariposa, numerous large trees were toppled by the high winds. Numerous large trees were downed in Yosemite National Park, with power outages and blocked roads in Yosemite Valley. ||Winds gusted to 45 mph at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport on December 1st, just shy of the record gust for December of 48 mph???on December 28th, 1991. Winds gusted to 60 mph at Tioga Pass, and over 50 mph at Coalinga. Trees were blown down at several locations, including Clovis and Mariposa. ||Officials at Devils Postpile National Monument in eastern Madera County reported widespread forest destruction in the monument with numerous large trees downed.  In addition roads were closed for months and several outbuildings were also damaged. ||An automated station at the summit of Mammoth Mountain a few miles to the east of Devils Postpile recorded sustained wind speed of 150 mph, and gusts in excess of 150 mph (the limit of the anemometer). Therefore wind gusts with this storm were estimated around 200 mph at the peak of the event early on December 1st. Red's Meadow in Devils Postpile is aligned in a NNE to SSW direction which favored the extreme downslope wind pattern from the nearby Sierra Peaks during this storm. The historic magnitude and duration of this event was caused primarily by an extreme pressure gradient set up between strong low pressure in the desert SW and strong high pressure off the Pacific NW coast.   ||This high wind event was known as a severe and relatively rare Mono Wind event; where winds flow over the Sierra Nevada and down into the foothills from the east instead of the typical westerly direction. These winds allow the air to warm adiabatically; temperatures rose dramatically in much of the San Joaquin Valley compared to the previous day.||Yet despite the severe winds, the southeastern part of the San Joaquin Valley remained almost completely wind sheltered and areas of dense fog developed during the night of November 30th-December 1st along a corridor stretching from Visalia south to Bakersfield."

The front became the focus for heavy rain as it nearly stalled across western Kentucky and southwest Indiana. Abundant moisture moved northeast along and just behind the front. This moisture interacted with a series of upper level disturbances to further increase heavy rainfall. A very large and persistent area of moderate rain caused a slow but steady rise in water levels. Rainfall amounts averaged about two inches every 12 hours, resulting in storm-totals from 4 to 5 inches. Small creeks, streams, and ditches reached or exceeded bankful.

Per NWS Cooperative Observers, amounts were fairly uniform, but some of the highest totals fell near Phillips (4.0 inches), in Grand Island (3.9 inches) and at the Hastings NWS Office (3.7 inches). Between the Highway 6 corridor and the Kansas state line, lesser amounts of 1-2 inches were common, with places such as Franklin and Hebron barely catching a dusting. Blowing and drifting snow was not a major issue during this event, with northeast winds only averaging 10-15 MPH. However, slick roads contributed to numerous accidents, including a two-vehicle collision that killed two teenagers on Highway 30 near Silver Creek. ||This event was centered squarely on the daytime hours, as the first flakes started falling north of Interstate 80 around sunrise. The majority of accumulations occurred between 9 AM and 5 PM, before diminishing to flurries during the evening and gradually ending from west to east. The primary mesoscale forcing for this event was tied to a broad zone of mid level frontogenesis, focused within the entrance region of a stout 120+ knot upper jet streak aligned from southeast South Dakota into the Great Lakes. On the larger scale, Nebraska was brushed by extensive mid level shortwave energy diving southeast across the Dakotas, rotating around the southwest periphery of a deep Hudson Bay vortex.

MICHIGAN,26,2013,April,Dense Fog,0,0,0,0,RAWS,"During a roughly 22-hour period from the early afternoon of Monday the 19th through late morning of Tuesday the 20th, this six-county portion of North Central Kansas experienced quite a north-to-south contrast in snowfall amounts, ranging from barely a trace along the Nebraska border, to a widespread 6 to locally 8 inches across mainly southern portions of Rooks, Osborne and Mitchell Counties. In between these two extremes, locations between the Highway 36 and Highway 24 corridors generally ranged from 0.5 to 4 inches. Per reports from various sources, some of the highest totals fell at Zurich (8 inches), Hunter (6 inches), Natoma (6 inches) and 17 miles south of Osborne (6 inches). As it turned out, this portion of North Central Kansas only caught the very northern edge of a significant winter storm that slammed much of western and central Kansas with even higher snow totals of 8-15 inches. In addition to the snow itself, north-northeast winds became a factor during this event.  Sustained speeds of around 20 MPH and gusts to around 35 MPH resulted in considerable drifting and visibility restrictions, especially on the evening of the 19th as surface low pressure intensified in Texas and western Oklahoma.  ||In the mid and upper levels, the main player behind this snowfall was a powerful closed low ejecting from eastern New Mexico on the afternoon of the 19th, to eastern Kansas on the afternoon of the 20th, although gradually weakening as it churned northeast. Most of the heavier snow bands were concentrated in the first several hours of the event between the mid-afternoon and mid-evening of the 19th, as upper level diffluence and attendant mid level frontogenesis peaked in intensity between the closed low approaching from the southwest, and the entrance region of a strong northern stream jet streak centered from northern Iowa across the Great Lakes. At the same time, the sharp north edge of accumulating snowfall was reinforced by the intrusion of dry low level air from a nearby surface ridge axis. Although bands of moderate to heavy snow became a bit more fragmented by midnight of the 20th, occasional flare-ups of banded snow continued through the late night and into the day, before largely ending by late morning. For several days after this event, a daily temperature gradient of at least 5-10 degrees took shape between areas nearer the Nebraska border with little to no snow cover, and the deeper snow pack across southern portions of Rooks, Osborne and Mitchell Counties."

A summer-like Bermuda high pressure area was anchored off the southeast U.S. coast.  A stationary front extended across the lower Mississippi valley toward the mid-Atlantic with a cold front approaching from the west of this region from Texas toward the Great lakes.  The air mass across the region in advance of the stationary front was extremely moist, warm, and unstable for mid-December.  As an embedded strong short wave traversed the region in the southwest flow aloft, a period of strong shear and marginal instability translated across the region during the late afternoon and early evening.  These synoptic features supported a strong to severe quasi-linear convective system, or squall line, which moved across the state from west to east during the late afternoon and evening.  The line of thunderstorms spawned a half-a-dozen tornadoes causing extensive damage across several counties from west central into northwest and north central Georgia.  As the line moved east past Atlanta, it weakened considerably and no further severe weather was observed across east Georgia.

This was a similar pattern to what occurred early in the month. Low temperatures reached the 20s in many locations in the San Joaquin Valley, and low- to mid-20s occurred once again in Hanford and Lemoore during Christmas weekend and into the next couple of days after Christmas Day. Some locations in the Kern County desert experienced minimum temperatures in the lower teens during the period. Fog development was generally limited and localized during this time due to a lack of surface moisture.||Bakersfield had a low of 28 degrees on 4 consecutive days (December 24th-27th), tying the coldest day of the month. Yet the high at Bakersfield on Christmas Day was 64, and reached 65 the next day for the warmest day of the month. This was a diurnal swing of 37 degrees for December 26th.||By the 28th, temperatures began to moderate so that nighttime lows were milder until the end of the month. More lower-level moisture moved in from the coast and also contributed to the moderation of the airmass over the San Joaquin Valley. In addition, high clouds moved over the area as weak upper level impulses moved over the region. The upper-level ridge set up over the area on the 30th, allowing the return of San Joaquin Valley fog by the morning of the 31st.||December was a very dry month for much of the forecast area. Little or no snow fell in the Sierra Nevada or any of the mountain areas, and no measureable rain fell in either Fresno or Bakersfield. Fresno had no precipitation measured during this month, while Bakersfield had a trace of rain on the 12th and 13th. Fresno tied December 1989 for the driest December on record; Bakersfield tied for third driest (5 other Decembers since record keeping began in 1887 have recorded a trace, while two had no rainfall). High pressure was persistent along the coast of California for much of the month, and storm systems generally traversed over the Pacific Northwest.||Cooler than average temperatures were realized throughout the region, especially in terms of daily minimum temperatures. Fog development was generally limited over the San Joaquin Valley, so daytime high temperatures reached above average. However, plenty of cooling took place during many of the nights due to generally clear skies, so low temperatures were well below normal for the month. Bakersfield was around 2 degrees below the monthly average temperature, while Fresno was just shy of 1 degree below the average. In summary, this month was cooler and much drier than average."

It was deemed uninhabitable. Another downed tree blocked Stoney Ridge Road in Easton. There were a couple of other trees that were knocked down on county roads. In Caroline County, a downed tree caused about 235 Delamrva Power customers to lose power in Cordova. In Queen Anne's County, about 750 homes and businesses lost power in Centreville, Queenstown and Millington when a couple of trees and poles were knocked down. Peak wind gusts included 52 mph in Salisbury (Wicomico County) and 49 mph in Easton (Talbot County). The strong south to southwest winds were caused by the pressure difference between a departing high pressure system and an approaching cold front from the Ohio Valley. The strong winds ceased after the cold front moved through during the early evening."

Although the afternoon featured seasonably warm temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s, low level moisture was scant with surface dewpoints only in the 30s. Despite most-unstable CAPE values of only a few hundred J/kg at most, these low-topped storms became efficient wind producers in the presence of the steep low level lapse rates and strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots, with evaporating rainfall only enhancing outflow winds.

One man was killed when he was impaled by a falling tree limb while driving along U.S. Highway 36, north of Boulder.  High winds blew several vehicles off Interstate 76 near Sterling, forcing the closure of the interstate to high profile vehicles.  One driver was injured when his semi trailer was blown off the interstate and rolled onto its side.  Visibilities over the northeast corner of the state were also reduced significantly by a combination of blowing dust and blowing snow.  The high winds also forced the closure of Interstate 25 at the Wyoming border.  Downed power lines also sparked several small grassfires.  The strong winds produced extensive damage to fences and some roofs, and also knocked down trees resulting in power outages to approximately 19,000 residents.  In Fort Collins, a large light pole in Hughes Stadium at Colorado State University, crashed onto the upper press box level and slid into the stadium seating area.

Severe to extreme drought continued across a large part of the Big Country, Concho Valley and the Northwest Hill Country while extreme to exceptional drought continued across the western Northern Edwards Plateau.   ||According to the Texas Crop Weather Report prepared by the Texas A&M Agriculture Program, the following agricultural impacts were noted across West Central Texas. ||A large part of West Central Texas had very mild temperatures and much needed rain. The slow, soaking rains boosted growth of cool-season grasses and forages. Wheat pastures continued to do very well and were providing grazing for livestock. The rains and warm weather also helped other small-grain crops. Farmers were preparing land for spring planting as weather permitted. Rangeland and pasture conditions were very good. Stock tanks were in good shape for this time of year. Producers continued supplemental feeding of livestock.||Across the northwestern Big Country, farmers were preparing fields for spring cotton planting. Livestock producers in that area were still providing heavy supplemental feed to livestock on pastures. Hay was in short supply, and some producers were still shipping it in from out of state. Wheat producers were holding off top-dressing and applying weed control until moisture conditions improved.||In Crockett County where lighter amounts of rain fell, livestock producers continued to feed their way through the winter, but hay was getting harder to find and very expensive when it could be found.

Maximum temperatures reached into the lower 70s in this part of the Valley, including in Bakersfield, as downslope winds allowed for further warming in this area. Rather cool overnight lows continued over much of the valley, and patchy dense fog briefly developed during the early morning hours.

It began in the late morning west of Madison, and in the mid to late afternoon toward Lake Michigan.  Snow to liquid ratios of 13:1 acted on 0.3 to 0.4 inch of liquid to produce widespread 4 to 6 inch snow totals.  The snow was generated by a closed 500 mb low that strengthened as it moved over Illinois and became negatively tilted as it crossed Indiana into Ohio and interacted with an open short-wave trough that dropped southeast into Wisconsin during the day on January 12th.  Moisture wrapping into the southern closed low was pulled up over southern Wisconsin ahead of the short wave trough and into an inverted trough of surface low pressure that extended back to the northwest from the main surface low on the Indiana/Ohio border.  The development of a secondary area of surface low pressure over Lower Michigan produced an area of low-level convergence across eastern sections of Southeast Wisconsin that kept the snow going from the late evening until after midnight. This added to snow totals in portions of Sheboygan...Fond Du Lac...Washington and Dodge counties, as well as Waukesha...Milwaukee...Racine and Kenosha counties, bringing total accumulations of 6.5 inches to 8 inches in these counties.  The greatest total was 8.1 inches in the city of Kenosha.  There were some spin-outs and vehicle accidents with a few minor injuries reported across southern Wisconsin.

A Winter Storm Watch was issued for the Southern Sierra Nevada, and Tioga Pass was closed on the 17th; this was the latest date on record that the Pass had been open until.||A weak upper-level trough moved through the central California interior during the night of January 19th-20th.

The total rainfall for Fresno on the 21st was 0.79 inch; the old record rainfall had been 0.52 inch, set in 2010.||Lines of showers with a few embedded thunderstorms moved through the central California interior during the early morning hours of January 21st. These lines of convective activity brought locally heavy rain, gusty winds and a few lightning strikes. Scattered thunderstorms continued through the day, producing pea-size hail and a funnel cloud. Tree limbs were blown down by the winds, with downed limbs reported near Lake Isabella and in Yosemite National Park. One large tree limb in the Park fell on a tent cabin, resulting in the death of the occupant.||The third, and final, trough reached central California on the 23rd. This system also brought thunderstorms with small hail. A funnel cloud also was observed. In the Southern Sierra Nevada, snowfall totals from the three storms reached 1?? feet in the high country.||An upper-level ridge built into California behind the departing storm. With abundant ground moisture, the stable airmass allowed the lower layers of the atmosphere to cool to saturation. Consequently, areas of dense fog developed the central and southern San Joaquin Valley. The next few nights saw less fog, mainly confined to west of Highway 99. Clouds over the region during the night of January 26th-27th kept the San Joaquin Valley mostly fog free. However, an upper-level short-wave passing through California did produce areas of drizzle on the Valley floor. The clouds also kept low temperatures in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley unseasonably warm. Both Bakersfield and Fresno bottomed out in the lower 50s and tied their record high minimum temperatures for the 27th (51 and 52 degrees, respectively).||Low clouds persisted over the San Joaquin Valley through much of the day on the 27th, and redeveloped over much of the Valley overnight. Areas of dense fog formed around sunrise, mainly in Kern and Merced Counties, and persisted through late morning. Dense fog redeveloped over San Joaquin Valley again during the early morning of January 29th, and persisted through late morning; a few fog patches lingered into the early afternoon hours.||Mid and high clouds moved into California on the 29th ahead of an upper-level trough that weakened the persistent ridge. Due to the clouds, fog development during the morning of January 30th was patchy, with some areas not seeing fog until around sunrise.||An upper-level disturbance approached the central California coast on January 30th, and moved inland during the afternoon. The disturbance had enough dynamics to trigger isolated light rain showers over the central California interior. The showers brought measurable rain to a few locations, including Fresno and NAS Lemoore, and lingered past midnight into the early morning hours of January 31st.||Bakersfield tied for its 10th warmest January on record, and Fresno had its 16th warmest January on record. For the rain season to date, the central and southern San Joaquin Valley had only received between a third and a half of normal."

MICHIGAN,26,2013,June,Flash Flood,0,0,0,0,Coast Guard,"Leading up to this significant snow event, the preceding eight weeks had been unseasonably warm and dry across most of South Central Nebraska, with parts of the area likely drawing ever-closer to receiving a Category D2 (severe) drought designation from the U.S. Drought Monitor. However, this all changed during a roughly 42-hour period centered from Thursday evening the 2nd through Saturday afternoon the 4th. Within this time frame, much of the 24-county area experienced its biggest snowfall of the 2011-2012 winter season, with many areas tallying 6-13 inches of heavy, wet snow. Sporadic lightning accompanied some of the heaviest snow bands, resulting in ???thundersnow.???  In addition to (and prior to) the onset of snow, several counties mainly east of a Franklin to Grand Island line picked up rainfall ranging from 0.25-inch to over 1 inch. As a result, storm-total precipitation amounts from this system were quite notable for early February, and also quite welcome given the recent dry spell, with the majority of the 24-county area totaling between 1-2 inches. For parts of the area, including Hastings, these liquid-equivalent precipitation amounts were the highest on record for any two-day period during the month of February. ||Focusing on storm total snowfall, the heaviest corridor with amounts averaging at least 7 inches encompassed about 15 counties and was centered roughly 25 miles either side of a line extending from near Holdrege-Minden-Doniphan-Benedict.  This corridor of heaviest snow included Grand Island, Hastings and Kearney.  According to NWS Cooperative Observers, some of the highest amounts fell at Bradshaw (13.3 inches), Minden (12.2), York (11.0), Hastings (11.0) and Grand Island (9.4).  The combination of the heavy, wet snow, along with north winds gusting to around 30 MPH for several hours, resulted in at least minor tree damage and power outages across the area.  Outside the zone of heaviest snow, the far northern, western and southern portions of South Central Nebraska saw lesser amounts mainly in the 2-6 inch range, including locations such as Ord, Cozad, Elwood, and Hebron. For some of these areas outside the primary snow zone, this was not even the biggest snow event of the 2011-2012 winter season, with that distinction belonging to early-season December events. ||Looking at the timeline and meteorological background of this event, the culprit was a strong mid-upper level low pressure system that strengthened as it neared the Central Plains. Early in this event, temperatures remained warm enough to support rain as the first round of precipitation lifted across mainly eastern portions of South Central Nebraska between the evening of the 2nd and morning of the 3rd. As previously mentioned, rainfall amounts from this initial overnight round were commonly between 0.25 to over 0.75-inch, with one of the highest totals through sunrise on the 3rd featuring 0.97-inch near Shickley in Fillmore County. During the daylight hours on Friday the 3rd, the majority of the 24-county area experienced nothing more than off-and-on light rain or drizzle, while the initial band of heavy snow set up across western and north central Nebraska. Finally, as temperatures cooled on the evening of the 3rd, snow gradually picked up in coverage and intensity across the local area. The heaviest hourly rates of at least 1 inch per hour, along with pockets of thundersnow, focused between 8 PM on the 3rd and 6 AM on the 4th as the mid-level deformation zone pivoted across the area. During the daytime hours on Saturday the 4th, snow gradually decreased in intensity, with most additional accumulations in excess of 2 inches focused along and east of the Highway 281 corridor. One of the few areas where snow totals fell noticeably short of forecasted values included western Dawson County. This was largely due to the fact that concentrated snow bands ???jumped??? over this area, focusing off to the west early in the event, and then re-forming to..."

However, this building dryness was quelled during a roughly 42-hour period centered from Thursday evening the 2nd through Saturday afternoon the 4th. Within this time frame, much of the six-county area measured at least 1.00 to 1.50 inches of liquid precipitation in the form of both rain and snow. These precipitation totals were quite notable for early February considering that normal precipitation for the entire month is generally between 0.50 to 0.75-inch. Across most of the area, this precipitation included 2-5 inches of heavy, wet snow, with Long Island in northwest Phillips County reporting a localized 8-inch total. In contrast, most of Mitchell and southern Jewell Counties received little to no snow, although Beloit totaled 1.68 inches of precipitation mostly in the form of rain.

However, it had no effect on the above-normal temperatures across the region, as highs at both |Bakersfield and Fresno were 7 degrees above normal.||An upper-level ridge built into the state behind the trough. With a stable airmass in place, a stratus layer formed over the San Joaquin Valley on February 2nd. A dry northwest flow set up over California, with the central California interior between the departing trough to the east and the ridge to the west. This flow helped dissipate the stratus as the day progressed, with the last vestiges of the stratus lingering over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and the adjacent foothills.||The ridge remained over California through February 6th, and then it gave way to an approaching upper-level trough. Patchy fog developed over Merced and Madera Counties during the morning of the 3rd; otherwise mostly clear skies prevailed across the region. Overnight temperatures fell into the 30s under the clear skies, but highs in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley warmed into the mid 60s to mid 70s each day from the 3rd through the 5th.||The upper-level trough moved into the central California interior on February 6th. Temperatures over the northern parts of the region cooled, but the south end of the San Joaquin Valley warmed into the mid 70s in strong pre-frontal warming. Strong southeast winds funneled through the passes of the Tehachapi Mountains into the far south end of the Valley, spreading as far north as Bakersfield. Winds gusted to 73 mph at Grapevine Peak on the 6th, and to 45 mph at Meadows Field. A dust storm was created near Lamont by the gusty winds with near-zero visibility. Gusts between 35-45 mph continued over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley continued on February 7th, and sustained wind speeds of 53 mph near Pine Mountain Club in the Tehachapi Mountains.||On the afternoon of the 6th, strong winds in the Bakersfield area caused blowing dust. Winds estimated around 35 mph at around 545 pm caused blowing dust and a school bus and big rig collided at Fairfax Road and Panorama Boulevard in Bakersfield due to blowing dust.||On the morning of the 7th, strong winds knocked down power poles in both the Fresno and Bakersfield areas. ||Clouds associated with the trough spread over the San Joaquin Valley on the 7th and kept night-time temperatures mild.

High temperatures on February 19th were several degrees cooler than the previous day.||A trailing short-wave dropped through California on February 20th. This disturbance triggered a couple of afternoon showers near the Southern Sierra Nevada crest, but otherwise had no impact on the central California interior. Temperatures in most locations around the region were a few degrees warmer as the cold air began to moderate.||An upper-level ridge built toward the California coast on the 22nd, and remained near the state the next several days. Temperatures warmed to above normal on February 22nd, and a few degrees warmer on the 23rd before leveling off the next day as the ridge remained just offshore.||The upper-level ridge moved onshore on February 24th ahead of an approaching upper-level trough.

This EF0 tornado touched down five miles southeast of Randall in Jewell County at 528 PM and tracked east for roughly two miles, tearing a metal roof from a farm outbuilding along the way. Other than this tornado, the only other severe weather report was a 63 MPH wind gust at the Phillipsburg airport, from a combination of strong winds behind a passing cold front and downdrafts from light rain showers falling through dry air. ||Breaking down the event, a few non-severe elevated thunderstorms lifted from north to south across the area between 10 AM and 12 PM. In the wake of this early activity, modest clearing and resultant destabilization worked into western portions of the area during the early afternoon, in association with an advancing mid level dry slot. As a result, a few non-severe storms first developed into portions of Rooks and Phillips Counties between 215 PM and 3 PM.  Around 330 PM, the thunderstorm cluster that would eventually produce the tornado near Randall initiated just south of the area near Interstate 70. As this storm cluster drifted northeast into Osborne, Mitchell and southeast Jewell Counties it became increasingly organized, and rapidly assumed supercell characteristics and strong low-level rotation near and northeast of Beloit, before exiting the local area into Republic and northwest Cloud counties. A few more linear storms affected Jewell and Mitchell Counties after 7 PM, but all thunderstorms exited the six-county area by 8 PM. ||On the synoptic scale, this was a classic early-season severe weather setup for the area, featuring a strong, negatively tilted mid and upper level trough ejecting out of the Central Rockies into the Central Plains. At the surface, a well-defined surface low pressure system deepened to around 994 millibars as it tracked from east-central Colorado at mid-day, to central Nebraska by late afternoon. To the south of this low, a well-defined cold front and dryline surged east into central Kansas, sparking supercell development.  Late afternoon mesoscale parameters revealed a highly-sheared but only modestly unstable environment with surface dewpoints only in the low-mid 50s. Although surface-based CAPE only averaged around 1000 J/kg, both deep layer vertical wind shear and low-level 0-1 kilometer shear were quite impressive, topping out around 70 knots and 30-40 knots, respectively.  At the time of the tornado in Jewell County, effective storm relative helicity values were at least 500 m2/s2."

In addition to the tornado west of Greeley, a few other notable reports of wind damage in northern portions of South Central Nebraska included a feed grinder overturned near North Loup and an outbuilding destroyed southwest of Belgrade. ||Breaking down the event, an initial band of non-severe elevated thunderstorms lifted from north to south across much of South Central Nebraska between 10 AM and 1 PM. In the wake of this early activity, modest clearing and resultant destabilization worked into western portions of the area during the early afternoon, in association with an advancing mid level dry slot. As a result, isolated to scattered thunderstorms developed into portions of mainly Dawson, Gosper, Phelps, Furnas and Harlan Counties between 130 PM-330 PM. One of these storms became an organized low-topped supercell in Phelps and Buffalo Counties between 330 PM-430 PM, but resulted in only pea size hail reports in the Holdrege and Kearney areas. Later in the afternoon and early evening, mainly between 530 PM-830 PM, the coverage of strong to severe thunderstorms increased a bit for areas north of Interstate 80, and also east of Highway 281. The storm mode during this time was primarily comprised of fast-moving line segments with a few pockets of embedded rotation, such as that which produced the tornado near Greeley. By 830 PM, all thunderstorms had exited into eastern Nebraska. ||On the synoptic scale, this was a classic early-season severe weather setup for the area, featuring a strong, negatively tilted mid and upper level trough ejecting out of the Central Rockies into the Central Plains. At the surface, a well-defined surface low pressure system deepened to around 994 millibars as it tracked from east-central Colorado at mid-day, to central Nebraska by late afternoon. This allowed a well-defined surface triple point to develop into central Nebraska as a warm lifted north and a trailing cold front surged in from the west. Late afternoon mesoscale parameters revealed a highly-sheared but only modestly unstable environment with surface dewpoints only in the upper 40s to low 50s. Surface-based CAPE averaged under 1000 J/kg, but deep-layer vertical wind shear averaged least 50-60 knots, and low-level 0-1 kilometer shear featured impressive values of 35-50 knots. At the time of the tornado in Greeley County, effective storm relative helicity values were at least 600 m2/s2. ||In the wake of the departing storms and surface low pressure system, very strong westerly winds overspread South Central Nebraska, with gusts to around 50 MPH lasting well into the early morning hours of the 29th. The wintry side of this system narrowly missed northern portions of the area, as parts of north central Nebraska received several inches of snow."

Hall county was the only county in moderate (D1) drought conditions. In March, several precipitation events pushed rainfall totals to or above normal for the month. Drought impacts are typically low in late winter and early spring, which are among the driest times of the year on the Texas South Plains, and this period coincides with fairly low water demand.||Dry conditions through the month of February persisted through the early part of March. A strong low pressure system pushed into West Texas from the 18th to the 22nd and brought widespread thunderstorms to the region. Several areas over the southeastern Texas panhandle and the northern Rolling Plains received between two and three inches of rainfall for the month. Elsewhere, less precipitation was observed although amounts were still near normal for March. Some selected totals include 2.28 at Childress, 2.27 at White River Lake and 2.23 at Roaring Springs. Like much of the country east of the Rocky Mountains, March saw temperatures above climatological normals. The average temperature at both Lubbock and Childress were 6.4 and 7.7 degrees above normal respectively. These values placed the month at the second warmest March on record at both Lubbock and Childress. Keetch-Byram Drought Index values remained unchanged from February values. They ranged from 500-600 across the South Plains and northern Rolling Plains with 300-400 across the southern Rolling Plains.||Meteorologically, it appears as though the drought is easing but hydrologic data indicates potential for significant impacts to water supply and agriculture. Soil profiles in the top eight inches have continued to show gradual improvement with deeper soils below eight inch depth remaining largely deprived of significant moisture. Winter wheat producers were nearing harvesting their crop and cotton farmers were prepping for planting. Significant green up occurred over the Rolling Plains through March. Fuels this season have been significantly reduced from last year and only a few large fires have resulted despite several strong wind events.||Economic losses due to drought through March since the drought began were estimated near $2.4 billion."

Low pressure tracked from Missouri, to southern Lower Michigan, and on to eastern Canada, while rapidly strengthening.  Precipitation surged northward into the region on the evening of the 2nd.  This was primarily snow, except in parts of east central Lower Michigan (especially near Lake Huron), where temperatures were mild enough for rain.  Snow wound down on the morning of the 3rd, and though somewhat blustery winds occurred behind the system on the 3rd, blowing snow was limited because the snowfall was so wet.|Snow totals ranged from 6 to 14 inches across most of Northern Michigan.  Higher amounts fell near and west of Grand Traverse Bay, with a maximum amount of 20 inches near Lake Ann.  With relatively warm temperatures, the snow was very wet; Traverse City saw around a foot of snow during the night, with a low temperature of 33 degrees.  The snow stuck to everything, with the weight of the snow downing many, many trees and power lines.  Power outages were widespread, with an outright majority of Northern Michigan residents losing power at some time during or after the storm.  In Benzie County, 95 percent of residents lost power.  Outages lasted up to a week in some spots.  Great Lakes Energy described it as the worst snowstorm (in regards to power outages) in 30 years.  A number of counties and communities opened shelters to aid those without power or heat.  Also included in the tree damage was substantial damage to fruit trees in the Grand Traverse Bay region, particularly cherry trees.  In Corwith Township in Otsego County, the weight of snow caused the roof of the former township hall to collapse."

Areas west of the mountains generally received between one-half of an inch, and one inch of rain, through San Diego County came in somewhat higher, with some amounts near 2 inches along the coastal slopes. According to the Lytle Creek HADS gauge, approximately 3 inches of rain fell in the Lytle Creek drainage (mostly over a three-hour period), causing a 2 to 3 foot rise in the creek at a point where the bed was 25 feet wide. This rise in flow did not leave the creek banks. There were also several other instances of rocks and mud in roadways, but no major flooding occurrences. The San Bernardino County Mountains were the big snow winners with Arrowbear coming in at 28 inches, Big Bear with 12 inches and Wrightwood with 7 to 13 inches. The San Diego County Mountains were not far behind with Cuyamaca receiving 15+ inches, Julian with 12 inches, and Palomar Mountain with 10 inches. Snow drifts in the San Bernardino and San Diego Mountains were upwards of 2 to 3 feet in some areas. Most areas between 3000 and 7000 feet received between 4 and 10 inches, which when melted and combined with rain received up to 3 to 4 inches of liquid equivalent. One location, near the Lake Arrowhead COOP station reported around 5 inches of water equivalent. The snow level was particularly low with this event, bringing as much as 3 inches of snow down to around 2500 feet. Graupel was observed in Temecula, accumulating to around an inch at 1200 feet. The upper deserts received moderate amounts of rain ranging from less than one-quarter inch to over three-quarters of an inch at Phelan. Some snow fell near the desert mountain slopes as well, with Hesperia at around 1 inch. The lower deserts fared quite well, with one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch in the Coachella Valley and one-quarter to slightly over one inch in the San Diego County deserts.|Strong, gusty winds also accompanied this system.

The result was an extensive squall line that at one point extended from the Oklahoma Panhandle south to the western Permian Basin. Strong low-level shear in the vicinity of this squall line resulted in the formation of at least three persistent, non-tornadic circulations as observed by the NWS-LBB WSR-88D. One of these circulations was sampled in high detail by research meteorologists from Texas Tech University near Reese Center using mobile Doppler radars and high resolution surface stations (sticknets).

This short-track EF0 tornado struck shortly before sunrise and just before 7 AM CDT, during one of the climatologically least-favored times of day for tornadoes to occur in North Central Kansas. This tornado was the only known occurrence of severe weather associated with this event. ||Storms first entered this six-county portion of North Central Kansas from the south between 530 and 6 AM CDT, initially organized in a quasi-linear mode along the leading edge of a weakening squall line. However, between 6 and 7 AM CDT, a few storms along the far northeast edge of this advancing line intensified and became semi-discrete as they tracked north-northeast at 45-55 MPH across parts of Mitchell and Jewell Counties. It was one of these semi-discrete storms that abruptly assumed brief rotation per radar reflectivity and velocity data as it crossed the Highway 36 corridor east of Mankato, corresponding to the tornado damage report. By 730 AM CDT, this small cluster of semi-discrete storms exited northward into south central Nebraska, with no further reports of severe weather. ||Although the synoptic scale setup did not necessarily suggest the likelihood of early morning tornadic development, the mesoscale environment revealed a moist low level airmass, very strong low level shear, and sufficient instability with 0-1 kilometer mixed layer CAPE around 1000 J/kg.

MINNESOTA,27,2013,August,Heat,0,0,1,0,Insurance Company,"A very strong upper level trough of low pressure was in place to the west of Iowa.  Unseasonably warm and moist air pushed north into the state.  Record high temperatures occurred for several days, and on the 19th continued over the central and eastern part of the state.  Temperatures warmed into the low 80s with dewpoint readings in the low 60s.  The atmosphere became unstable with lifted indices around -3 C and most unstable CAPE values in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  The wind profile was fairly unidirectional, however speeds in the 850 to 500 mb level were in the 45 to 65 kt range.  Downdraft CAPE was around 600 J/kg.  Though the freezing level was quite low for a severe weather event, around 11,200 feet, CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was limited to around 100 J/kg.  Combined with very high precipitable water values, around 1.4 inches, the hail production was limited.  There was a decent amount of shear available for the storms with a shear value around 40 kts.  A line of thunderstorms formed ahead of a slow moving cold front that advanced east with the upper trough.  Small segmented lines formed that extended east-southeast out of the main north to south line.  These segments lifted rapidly north with the mean flow.  As a result, it was quite easy for the storms to produce high winds.  Winds near 60 MPH caused tree and power pole damage west of the Des Moines Airport with one of the storms.  One of the storms produced a small microburst and winds estimated of at least 75 MPH just west of the Des Moines Airport.  The high winds downed several large trees.  A small line segment produced 60 to 65 MPH winds as it moved through Hamilton County, north through the Mason City area in Cerro Gordo County."

One person was injured when a tree fell onto their pickup truck on Pennsylvania State Route 611 along the Northampton and Monroe County lines. The roadway was closed for a two mile stretch south of Delaware Water Gap in Monroe County. Peak wind gusts included 48 mph at the Lehigh Valley International Airport and Pottstown (Montgomery County), 46 mph in Mount Pocono (Sussex County). 45 mph at the Philadelphia International Airport, 44 mph in Forks Township (Northampton County) and 43 mph in Reading (Berks County) and Doylestown (Bucks County). The strong northwest winds were caused by the pressure difference between a high pressure system building into the Great Lakes and a low pressure system in the Canadian Maritimes. As the high pressure system moved closer during the evening of the 26th and the low pressure system moved offshore, winds diminished."

HAWAII,15,2013,September,Wildfire,0,0,0,0,Coast Guard,Smoke from a prescribed burn across southwestern Leon county combined with other smaller fires across northern Leon county to produce dense smoke across portions of the area.  A Florida Department of Transportation Spokesman said the smoke may have contributed to four crashes on Thomasville Road during the morning hours.  One crash occurred at the intersection of County Road 12 with three other crashes at the intersection of Sunny Hill Road.  A stretch of Thomasville Road was closed from County Road 12 to the Georgia state line because of smoky conditions.  The intersection of SR-61N and Cherokee Plantation Road was also blocked due to a crash and smoky conditions.  These crashes were due primarily to smoke from fires in the northern part of Leon county.  The KTLH ASOS reported visibilities below the local dense smoke criteria of 3 miles from 11 pm to 10 am EDT with a minimum value of 1/2 mile at 8 am EDT.  The smoke at the airport was likely due to the earlier controlled burn in southwest Leon county.

For nearly 3.5 hours mainly between 130 and 5 PM CDT, a cluster of strong to severe elevated storms drifted slowly north, at times becoming nearly stationary. Early in the event, copious amounts of hail ranging from pea to quarter size were reported in the Holbrook area, with slick spots developing on Highway 6 as a result. Although no hail reports were received farther north into Gosper County, radar continued to depict a mix of hail and heavy rain affecting mainly southwest and south central portions of the county. A limited number of rain gauges in the area reported less than 2 inches, but radar estimated that at least 3 inches of rain likely fell across a small, rural portion of southwest Gosper County. After going strong for several hours, this storm cluster abruptly dissipated by 530 PM CDT. Later in the evening mainly between 930 and 1130 PM CDT, a new area of strong storms flared up in southeast portions of South Central Nebraska affecting counties such as Thayer, but these storms did not become severe.||The afternoon round of severe elevated convection evolved from a narrow line of light showers that first developed around 12 PM CDT on the Nebraska-Kansas border.

PENNSYLVANIA,42,2013,September,Thunderstorm Wind,1,0,0,0,SNOTEL,"Between 530-730 PM CDT on this Friday, a lone severe thunderstorm drifted slowly southeast along a path from northwest Jewell County to far northeast Mitchell County. Along the way, golf ball size hail was reported several miles north of Burr Oak, and quarter size hail fell east of Mankato. During the 730-830 PM CDT time frame, the storm rapidly weakened and dissipated along the Mitchell-Cloud County line. On the synoptic scale, this storm was driven by forcing along the southwestern periphery of a mid level shortwave trough tracking from northeast Nebraska to western Iowa. Despite meager low level moisture with surface dewpoints only in the 40s, the combination of steep low-to-mid level lapse rates, most unstable CAPE values between 500-1000 J/kg and around 40 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear in the west-northwest flow aloft proved sufficient to kick up one severe storm.

COLORADO,8,2013,September,High Wind,0,0,0,0,Mariner,"Extreme (D4) drought conditions were reduced over the western South Plains and southern Rolling Plains during the month of April. Extreme (D4) and exceptional (D3) drought conditions remain largely unchanged elsewhere across the area. Childress county had dropped down to moderate (D1) drought conditions. April was characterized by very warm temperatures but also many days of beneficial rainfall. April typically marks the end of the dry season and a transition to increasing precipitation.||Warmer than seasonal average temperatures were observed throughout the month and especially at the end of the month. The warmer than normal temperatures were especially noticeable with the observed minimum temperatures. Many areas saw the earliest last freeze dates on record. Additionally, the all time April record maximum temperature was broken at Lubbock and Childress on April 25th. Lubbock reached 104 degrees while Childress reached 106 degrees. The average temperature of 67.1 for the month at Lubbock tied a record while 68.7 at Childress broke the previous April record. Despite the record warmth, several instances of beneficial rainfall occurred during the month and especially during the final week of April. Some selected rainfall totals include 3.82 at Lake Alan Henry, 2.76 at Jayton, 2.42 at Post and 2.38 at Wolfforth. Even though widespread rainfall was observed, most areas remained below normal for annual precipitation values. Keetch-Byram Drought Index values were highest over the western South Plains which were from 600 to 700. The southern Rolling Plains saw values between 300 and 400. Elsewhere, values ranged from 400 to 600.||Meteorologically, the drought continues to ease, but significant impacts are still possible in terms of water supply and agriculture. April, which is typically the end of the fire weather season, saw almost no wildfire activity. However, many counties have kept burns bans in tact. During the month, the city of Lubbock instituted stage 2 water restrictions which ranges from stage 1 (mild water shortage conditions) to stage 4 (emergency water shortage conditions). Winter wheat was considered almost a total loss due to the drought and was being harvested for use as hay and silage. Additional rains were still needed to sustain pasture and rangelands for much of the area. The final work was being performed in preparation of May planting with observed increases in soil moisture.||Economic losses due to drought through April since the drought began were estimated near $2.4 billion."

Nearly half of South Central Texas received one half inch or less of rain and the drought worsened in several counties. Frio and Kendall Counties moved back into extreme drought category (Stage D3) joining Edwards, Kerr, Kinney, and Real. Atascosa and Karnes went to severe category (Stage D2) while Bandera, Blanco, De Witt, Gillespie, Medina, and Val Verde Counties remained in this category. Ten counties still had burn bans in effect and fire danger at the end of the month was low to moderate. The Texas crop and weather report issued by Texas A and M Agricultural indicated higher than normal temperatures and windy conditions caused shallow soils to dry and crack. Winter weeds were burning up and there did not appear to be much grass left in pastures. These conditions were once again putting pressure on livestock producers to find forage for cattle. Most well managed hay pastures were cut for the first time, but yields were low and weedy and quality was poor. Some crops were starting to show signs of drought stress. Area lakes and reservoirs started to fall again, and remained well below normal pool elevations with Lake Travis around 43 feet below normal and Medina Lake 54 feet below. The seven day stream flow average over the Nueces, Lower Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins was in the below normal range and the Upper Guadalupe and Colorado basins were in the much below normal range.

Helicopters were used by the State Forest Fire Service to battle the blaze and plow lines had been established behind the houses on Sooy Place Road.  Controlled burns have been completed to reduce the threat of property damage. Overnight on the 9th, the fire did not grow due to the lower temperatures, increased humidity, and subsiding winds.  The fire reached about 50 percent containment.  On noon on the 10th,  the wildfire reached 75 percent containment.  It was expected to consume about 1000 acres before total containment was reached.|  |A second wildfire occurred on the Fort Dix Military Installation, near the Burlington and Ocean County border on the 9th.

In fact, the potential for tornadoes increased during the early evening hours of April 13th as the low level jet (strong winds just above the surface) became stronger.||The first tornadic activity of the day occurred in central Oklahoma as a tornado touched down just southwest of Norman at 3:59 pm CDT, and then moved east-northeast through the heart of that city shortly after 4:00 pm CDT. This tornado was eventually rated an EF-1 as it damaged many businesses and homes, and numerous trees and power lines were also downed.
